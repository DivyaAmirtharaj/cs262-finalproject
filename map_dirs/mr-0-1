i
squatted—
was
a

as
as
were

whereon
what

we
of

if
always
wandered
every

was
a
cheerful
invitation
make
my
of
equal
simplicity

i
may
say
innocence
with
i
as
sincere
a
worshipper
of
aurora
as
greeks
i
got
up
early
and
in
was
a
exercise
and
one
of
which
i
say
characters
were
engraven
on
of
king
effect
completely
each
it
again
and
again
and
again
i
can
understand
morning
ages
i
was
as
much
affected

itself
an
iliad

odyssey
in

singing
its

wrath
and
wanderings
was
something
cosmical
about
it
a
standing
advertisement
of
everlasting

of

morning
which
is
most
memorable
season
of

somnolence
in

slumbers
all

undulations
of

a

a

who
each
contains
an

way
after

cessation
of

soul
of

each

genius
again
what
it
can
make
all

i
should
say
in

in

all

in

same
words
and
sung
a
woodnymph
at
evening
of
some
cow
in

sounded
sweet

melodious
and
at
i
would
mistake
it
of
certain
minstrels
whom
i
was
sometimes
serenaded
who
might

soon
i
was
unpleasantly

express
my

of

i

i
clearly
it

music
of

were
at
one

seven

gone
whippoorwills

sing

with

a
as

a
string
when
i
was

sang
at

were
again

a

more
awful
a

gurgling
melodiousness—i
myself
with

it—expressive
of
a

a

a
of
cattle
market
who
inquired
of

i
could
my

give
up
so
many
of
comforts
of

answered
i
was
sure
i
it
well
i
was
and
so
i
went
my

way
and
mud
would
some
in
morning

of
awakening

coming

man
makes
indifferent
all

where
may
occur
is
always

anywhere
in

inexhaustible

which
country
offers
on

its
great
guns
which
echo
woods

some
waifs
of
martial

occasionally
me
away
in
my

of

sounded
as

i
was

at

i
known
about

commonly
an

some

so
my
all

me
it
in

anciently
indians
were
a
upon
a
which
as
into
as
sinks
into

used
much
as
story
goes

one
of
which
indians
were
guilty
and
while
were

shook

only
one

escaped

was
it
conjectured
when
shook

shore
it

certain
at
any

is
one
and
indian
in
any
conflict
with
account
of
ancient
settler
whom
i
mentioned
who
so
well
when

concluded
a

at

sometimes
it

come
up

would
go

was

is

so
many

where

it

me
it

when

quite
wild
and
all
mother
up
and
were
spitting
at
me
a
years
i
in

a

when
i
called

she
was
gone
ahunting
in

i
am
sure
whether
it
was
a

when
i
went
get
a

early
in

i

i
again
sometimes

i
was
along

one
calm
october
afternoon
such

in
over
a
suddenly
one
sailing

middle

set
up
wild
and
i
with
a
and
when
came
up
i
was
again
i
miscalculated
would
and
we
were
apart
when
came
surface
i
widen
interval
and
again
and
and
with
more
manœuvred
so
cunningly
i
could
get
within
a
of
each
when
came
surface
way
and
cooly
surveyed
water
and
and
apparently
chose
course
so
might
come
up
where
was
widest
expanse
of
water
and
at
greatest
it
was
surprising
quickly
made
up
mind
and
into
execution
me
at
once
widest
of
and
could
it
while
was

in

it
was
a

on

your

and
is
yours
where
will
appear
again
sometimes
would
come
up
unexpectedly
on
opposite
side
of

was
and
so
unweariable
when
swum

immediately
again

another

speeding
way
amid

yet
appeared
know
course
as
surely
under
water
as
on
surface
and
swam
much
once
or
i
saw
a
where
approached
surface
out
and
instantly
again
i
it
was
as
well
me
on
my
oars
and
wait
as
endeavor
calculate
where
would
again
and
again
when
i
was
straining
my
eyes
over

one
way
i
would
suddenly
startled
unearthly
me
why
after
so
much
cunning
invariably
moment
came
up
white
enough
was
indeed
a
silly
i
i
could
commonly
splash
of
water
when
came
up
and
so
also
after
an
seemed
as
as
ever
as
willingly
and
swam
yet
at
it
was
surprising
see
serenely
sailed
off
with
unruffled
when
came
surface
all
work
with
webbed
usual
was
yet
somewhat
of
a
waterfowl
occasionally
when
me
most
successfully

come
up

uttered
a
unearthly
more
of
a
wolf
any
as
when
a
muzzle
ground
and
was
wildest
sound
is
ever
making
woods
and
wide
i
concluded
in
of
my
efforts
confident
of
own
sky
was
overcast
was
so
smooth
i
could
see
where
surface
when
i
white
stillness
of
air
and
smoothness
of
water
were
all
against
at
come
up
off
uttered
one
of
as
if
calling
on
god
of
aid
and
immediately
came
a
wind
east
and
surface
and
whole
air
with
misty
and
i
was
impressed
as
if
it
were
of
answered
and
god
was
angry
with
me
and
so
i
away
on
surface
in
i
watched
cunningly
and
and
middle
of
sportsman
which
will
in
when
compelled
would
sometimes
circle
and
and
over
at
a
considerable
which
could
easily
see
other
and
motes
in
sky
and
when
i
gone
off
since
would
settle
a
slanting
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
on
a
which
was
what
safety
got
sailing
in
middle
of
walden
i
know
unless

same
i
in

i
went
agraping

myself
with

i
admired

gather

i
collected
a
small

of
wild
apples
coddling

overlooked
when

up

it
was
exciting
at

one
which
almost
overshadowed

scented

sixty
years

end
on
of
civil
i
accept
motto—that
government
is
which
governs
and
i
should
see
it
acted
up
more
and
systematically
carried
out
it
amounts
which
also
i
government
is
which
governs
at
all
and
when
men
are
it
will
kind
of
government
which
will
government
is
at
an
expedient
most
governments
are
usually
and
all
governments
are
sometimes
inexpedient
objections
which
against
a
standing
army
and
are
many
and
weighty
and
may
also
at
against
a
standing
government
standing
army
is
only
an
arm
of
standing
government
government
itself
which
is
only
mode
which
chosen
execute
will
is
equally
abused
and
can
act
it
witness
mexican
war
work
of
comparatively
a
individuals
using
standing
government
as
in
outset
would
consented
measure
american
government—what
is
it
a
a
one
endeavoring
itself
unimpaired
each

some
of
its
integrity
it
and
of
a
single
man
a
single
man
can
it
will
it
is
a
sort
of
wooden
gun
and
if
ever
should
use
it
in
earnest
as
a
one
against
each
other
it
will
surely
split
it
is
must
some
complicated
machinery
or
other
and
its
satisfy
idea
of
government
which
governments
show
successfully
men
can
imposed
on
even
impose
on
own
advantage
it
is
excellent
we
must
all
allow
yet
government
of
itself
any
enterprise
alacrity
with
which
it
got
out
of
its
way
it
keep
country
it
settle
west
it
educate
character
inherent
in
american
all
accomplished
and
it
would
somewhat
more
if
government
sometimes
got
in
its
way
government
is
an
expedient
which
men
would
succeed
in
one
another
alone
and
as
said
when
it
is
most
expedient
governed
are
most
alone
it
and
commerce
if
were
made
of
india
would
manage
over
obstacles
which
are
continually
in
way
and
if
one
were
men
wholly
effects
of
actions
and
intentions
would
classed
and
with
mischievous
who
obstructions
on
speak
and
as
a
citizen
unlike
who
call
men
i
ask
at
once
government
at
once
a
government
every
man
make
known
what
kind
of
government
would
command
and
will
one
step
obtaining
it
after
all
why
when
is
once
in
of
a
majority
are
and
a
continue
is
are
most
in
seems
minority
are
strongest
a
government
in
which
majority
in
all
cases
can

even
as
as
men
understand
it
can
a

in
which
majorities
and
wrong
conscience—in
which
majorities
only
questions
which
of

is
applicable
must
citizen
ever
a
moment
or
in
conscience
why
every
man
a
conscience
i
we
should
men
and
subjects
afterward
it
is
cultivate
a
so
much
as
only
obligation
which
i
a
assume
is
at
any
what
i
it
is
enough
said
a
corporation
conscience
a
corporation
of
conscientious
men
is
a
corporation
with
a

made
men
a
whit
more
and
means
of
it
even
welldisposed
are
made
agents
of

a

a

all
marching

aye
against

marching
indeed
