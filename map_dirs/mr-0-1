as

what

was
a

invitation
make
my

i
may
say
innocence
with
i
as
sincere
a
worshipper
of

as
greeks
i
got
up
early
and
in
was
a
exercise
and
one
of
which
i

characters
were
engraven
on
of
king
effect
completely

again

again

again
i
can
understand
morning
ages
i
was

itself
an

odyssey
in

singing
its

something
cosmical
about
it
a

advertisement
of

each

again
what
it

all

in

same
words
and
sung
a

at
evening
of
some
cow
in

sounded
sweet

melodious
and
at
i
would
mistake
it
of
certain
minstrels
whom
i
was
sometimes
serenaded
who
might

i
clearly
it

music
of

a

at

gurgling
melodiousness—i
myself

it—expressive
of

a

market
who
inquired

i
could
my

give
up
so
many
of
comforts
of

answered
i
was
sure
i
it
well
i
was
and
so
i
went
my

way
and
mud
would
some
in

man
makes
indifferent
all

where

always

which
country
offers
on

its

guns
which
echo
woods

some
waifs
of

occasionally
me
away
in

of

sounded
as

at

i
known

some

so
my
all

me
it
in

anciently
indians
were
a
upon
a

as
into
as

used
much
as

goes

one
of
which
indians
were
guilty

while

shook

only
one

escaped

was
it
conjectured
when

shore
it

certain
at

is
one

indian
in
any
conflict
with
account
of
ancient
settler
whom
i
mentioned
who
so
well
when

concluded
a

come
up

go

is

me
it

were
spitting
at

whether

when
i
went

early
in

set
up

i
with
a

when

up
i
was

i
miscalculated

and
we
were
apart
when
came

i
widen
interval
and
again
and
and
with
more
manœuvred
so
cunningly
i
could
get
within
a
of
each
when
came
surface
way
and
cooly
surveyed
water
and
and
apparently
chose
course
so
might
come
up
where
was
widest
expanse
of
water
and
at
greatest
it
was
surprising
quickly
made
up
mind
and
into
execution
me
at
once

of

could
it
while

yours
where
will
appear
again
sometimes
would
come
up
unexpectedly
on

was
and
so
unweariable
when

speeding

amid

yet
appeared
know
course
as
surely
under

as
on

and
swam
much
once
or
i
saw
a
where
approached
surface
out
and
instantly
again
i
it
was
as
well
me
on
my
oars
and
wait
as
endeavor
calculate
where
would
again
and
again
when
i
was
straining
my
eyes
over

one
way
i
would
suddenly
startled
unearthly
me
why
after
so
much
cunning
invariably
moment
came
up
white
enough
was
indeed
a
silly
i
i
could
commonly
splash
of
water
when
came
up
and
so
also
after
an
seemed
as
as
ever
as
willingly
and
swam
yet
at
it
was
surprising
see
serenely
sailed
off
with
unruffled
when
came
surface
all
work
with

was
yet
somewhat
of
a
waterfowl
occasionally
when

successfully

uttered
a
unearthly
more
of
a
wolf
any
as
when
a
muzzle
ground
and
was
wildest
sound
is
ever
making
woods
and
wide
i
concluded
in
of
my
efforts
confident
of
own
sky
was
overcast
was
so
smooth
i
could
see
where
surface
when
i
white
stillness
of
air
and
smoothness
of
water
were
all
against
at
come
up
off
uttered
one
of
as
if
calling
on
god
of
aid
and
immediately
came
a
wind
east
and
surface
and
whole
air
with
misty
and
i
was
impressed
as
if
it
were
of
answered
and
god
was
angry
with
me
and
so
i
away
on
surface
in
i
watched
cunningly
and
and
middle
of
sportsman
which
will
in
when
compelled
would
sometimes
circle
and
and
over
at
a
considerable
which
could
easily
see
other
and
motes
in
sky
and
when
i
gone
off
since
would
settle
a
slanting
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
on
a
which
was
what
safety
got
sailing
in
middle
of
walden
i
know
unless

i
in

went

myself
with

admired

collected
a
small

up

end
on
of
civil
i
accept
motto—that
government
is
which
governs
and
i
should
see
it
acted
up
more
and
systematically
carried
out
it
amounts
which
also
i
government
is
which
governs
at
all
and
when
men
are
it
will
kind
of
government
which
will
government
is
at
an
expedient
most
governments
are
usually
and
all
governments
are
sometimes
inexpedient
objections
which
against
a
standing
army
and
are
many
and
weighty
and
may
also
at
against
a
standing
government
standing
army
is
only
an
arm
of
standing
government
government
itself
which
is
only
mode
which
chosen
execute
will
is
equally
abused
and
can
act
it
witness
mexican
war
work
of
comparatively
a
individuals
using
standing
government
as
in
outset
would
consented
measure
american
government—what
is
it
a
a
one
endeavoring
itself
unimpaired
each

some
of
its
integrity
it
and
of
a
single
man
a
single
man
can
it
will
it
is
a
sort
of
wooden
gun
and
if
ever
should
use
it
in
earnest
as
a
one
against
each
other
it
will
surely
split
it
is
must
some
complicated
machinery
or
other
and
its
satisfy
idea
of
government
which
governments
show
successfully
men
can
imposed
on
even
impose
on
own
advantage
it
is
excellent
we
must
all
allow
yet
government
of
itself
any
enterprise
alacrity
with
which
it
got
out
of
its
way
it
keep
country
it
settle
west
it
educate
character
inherent
in
american
all
accomplished
and
it
would
somewhat
more
if
government
sometimes
got
in
its
way
government
is
an
expedient
which
men
would
succeed
in
one
another
alone
and
as
said
when
it
is
most
expedient
governed
are
most
alone
it
and
commerce
if
were
made
of
india
would
manage
over
obstacles
which
are
continually
in
way
and
if
one
were
men
wholly
effects
of
actions
and
intentions
would
classed
and
with
mischievous
who
obstructions
on
speak
and
as
a
citizen
unlike
who
call
men
i
ask
at
once
government
at
once
a
government
every
man
make
known
what
kind
of
government
would
command
and
will
one
step
obtaining
it
after
all
why
when
is
once
in
of
a
majority
are
and
a
continue

most
in

minority
are
strongest
a

in
which

in
all
cases
can

even

understand
it
can
a

majorities
and
wrong
conscience—in
which
majorities
only
questions
which
of

is
applicable
must
citizen
ever
a

or
in
conscience
why
every
man
a
conscience
i
we
should

and
subjects
afterward
it
is
cultivate
a
so
much
as
only
obligation
which
i
a
assume
is
at
any
what
i
it
is
enough
said
a

conscience
a

of

a

with
a

made

a
whit
more

means
of

even
welldisposed

agents
of

all
marching

a

it
gave
me
a
when
i
so
and
as
i
saw

gaze
after

wondered
whether

my
sister

more
years
older

and
established
a
great
with
and
she
me
up
at
out
myself
what
expression
meant
and
knowing
a
and
and
much
in
of
it
upon
as
well
as
upon
me
i
supposed
gargery
and
i
were
up
she
was
a
goodlooking
woman
my
sister
and
i
a
general
impression
she
must
made
gargery
marry
was
a
man
with
curls
of

each
side
of
smooth

with
eyes
of
such
a
undecided
seemed
somehow
got
mixed
with

a
mild
goodnatured
sweettempered
easygoing
sort
of
in
strength
and
also
in
weakness
my
sister
mrs
with
and
eyes
such
a
of
skin
i
sometimes
used
wonder
whether
it
was

washed
with
a
instead
of

she
was
and
and
almost
always
wore
a
coarse
apron
over
with

a
square
impregnable
in
was
stuck
of
and
she
made
it
a
merit
in
and
a
strong
against
she
wore
apron
so
much
i
see
why
she
should
worn
it
at
all
or
why
if
she
wear
it
at
all
she
should
it
off
every
of

what
it

a
of
and
a
you
miss
such
an
article
as
a
asked
sergeant
confidentially
my
wife
at
moment
when
you
came
in
you

so
said
my
convict
eyes
on
in
a
moody
manner
and
without
glance
at
me—so
you’re

you
i’m
sorry

miserable
us
something
i
clicked
in
man’s
again
and
and
guard
were
so
we
made
of
stakes
and
stones
and
saw
into
which
was
a
crew
of
convicts
one
seemed
surprised
see
or
interested
in
seeing
or
glad
see
or
sorry
see
or
spoke
a
word
except
somebody
in
growled
as
if
give
way
you
which
was
signal
of
oars
of
we
saw
out
a
way
mud
of
shore
a
wicked
ark
cribbed
and
and
moored
massive
chains
seemed
in
my
young
eyes
ironed
we
saw
go
alongside
and
we
saw
up
side
and
ends
of
were
into
water
and
went
out
as
if
it
were
all
over
with
chapter
my
state
of
mind
which
i
so
unexpectedly
exonerated
impel
me
i
it
some
of
good
at
of
it
i
i
any
of
conscience
in
mrs
when
of
out
was
off
me
i
in
early
me
as
my
inner
self
was
so
easily
composed
it
was
much
upon
my
mind
when
i
saw
about
i
ought
whole
yet
i
and
i
mistrusted
if
i
would
me
worse
i
was
of
confidence
and
of
sitting
in
chimney
corner
at
staring
at
my
companion
and
up
my
i
morbidly
myself
if
knew
it
i
afterwards
could
see
at
whisker
without
was
meditating
on
it
if
knew
it
i
afterwards
could
see
glance
casually
at
yesterday’s
meat
or
when
it
came
on
without
was
whether
i
in
if
knew
it
and
at
any
subsequent
of
our
was
or
conviction
suspected
in
it
would
a
of
my
in
a
word
i
was
cowardly
what
i
knew
as
i
cowardly
avoid
what
i
knew
wrong
i
intercourse
with
world
at
and
i
imitated
of
its
many
inhabitants
who
act
in
manner
quite
an
untaught
genius
i
made
of
of
action
myself
as

a
as
you

know
i
instantly
went
out
in
a
and
asked
estella

question
my
child
who
camilla
i
and
i
shall
often
of
with
when
i
wake
up
in
of

combined
with
echoing
of
some
cry
or
call
along

i
come
interrupted
conversation
and
caused
estella
say
me
on
my
all
at
me
with
utmost
contempt
and
as
i
went
out
i
sarah
say
well
i
am
sure
what

camilla
add
with
indignation
was
ever
such
a
idea
as
we
were
going
with

candle
along
estella
stopped
all
of
a
sudden
and
said
in
manner
with
quite
close
mine—

almost
over
and
checking
myself
she
stood
at

so
she
when

slapped
my
with
such
as

said
she

coarse
monster

was
inwardly
crying
and
i
know

i
know
of
she
cost
me
afterwards
we
went
on
our
way
upstairs
after

a
gentleman
groping

i
was
glad

wondered
whether

much
consider
subject
we
were
soon
in

as
i
estella

in
seemed
colder

certain
wintry

or
it
would
more
expressive
say
its

was
spacious
and
i
say
once
every
in
it
was
covered
with

mould
and
most
object
was
a
with
a
spread
on
it
as
if
a

is
much
whether
a
gate
in
garden
wall
which
i
scrambled
up
over
on
occasion
was
on
occasion
open
or
shut
enough
i
saw
gate
and
i
saw
one
as
it
stood
open
and
as
i
knew
estella
out—for
she
with
keys
in
strolled
into
garden
and
strolled
all
over
it
it
was
quite
a
wilderness
and
were
old
melonframes
and
cucumberframes
in
it
which
seemed
in
a
spontaneous
growth
of
weak
attempts
at
of
old
and
with
and
a
weedy
offshoot
into
of
a
saucepan
when
i
exhausted
garden
and
a
greenhouse
with
in
it
a
grapevine
and
some
i
myself
in
corner
upon
which
i
out
of
window
questioning
a
moment
was
empty
i
in
at
another
window
and
myself
my
great
surprise
exchanging
a
stare
with
a
young
gentleman
with
eyelids
and
young
gentleman
quickly
and
me
at
when
i
myself
staring
at
and
i
saw
was
inky
said
young
a
general
observation
which
i
usually
observed
answered
itself
i
said
omitting
young
who
you
in
said
miss
estella
who
gave
you
about
miss
estella
come
and
said
young
gentleman
what
could
i
i
often
asked
myself
question
since
what
else
could
i
manner
was
so
and
i
was
so
astonished
i
where
as
if
i
under
a
spell
stop
a
minute
said
wheeling
we
gone
many
i
ought
give
you
a
it
is
in
a
most
irritating
manner
instantly
slapped
against
one
another
one
of
up
my
slapped
again
and
it
into
my
stomach
mentioned
it
was
unquestionably
in
of
a
was
after
and
meat
i
out
at
and
was
going
out
again
when
said
aha
would
you
and
and
in
a
manner
quite
unparalleled
within
my
experience
of
game
said
skipped
on
skipped
on
come
ground
and
go
and
and
all
sorts
of
while
i
at
i
was
secretly
afraid
of
when
i
saw
so
i
morally
and
convinced
of
could
in
of
my
stomach
and
i
a
consider
it
irrelevant
when
so
obtruded
on
my
attention
i
without
a
word
a
of
garden
of
walls
and
screened
some
on
asking
me
if
i
was
satisfied
with
ground
and
on
my
yes
my
absent
a
moment
and
quickly
with
a
of
water
and
a
sponge
in
available
said
against
wall
and
off
only
and
waistcoat
shirt
in
a
manner
at
once
and
although
on
and
a
out
at
mouth—these
quite
appalled
me
i
about
my
own
age
was
much
and
a
way
of
spinning
about
was
of
appearance
was
a
young
gentleman
in
a
grey
suit
when
with
elbows
knees
wrists
and
considerably
in
advance
of
of
as
my
me
when
i
saw
squaring
at
me
with
every
of
mechanical
and
eyeing
my
anatomy
as
if
were
minutely
choosing
i
so
surprised
in
my
as
i
was
when
i
out
and
saw
on
up
at
me
with
a
and
exceedingly
was
on
and
after
sponging
with
a
great
show
of
squaring
again
second
greatest
surprise
i
ever
in
my
was
seeing
on
again
up
at
me
out
of
a
eye
spirit
inspired
me
with
great
seemed
strength
and
once
me
and
was
always
knocked
would
up
again
in
a
moment
sponging
or
out
of
waterbottle
with
greatest
satisfaction
in
seconding
according
and
came
at
me
with
an
air
and
a
show
made
me
was
going
me
at
got
i
am
sorry
more
i
i
came
up
again
and
again
and
again
until
at
got
a
with
of
against
wall
even
after
crisis
in
our
affairs
got
up
and
and
confusedly
a
knowing
where
i
was
went
on
knees
sponge
and
it
up
at
same
out
means
you
won
seemed
so
and
innocent
although
i
contest
i
a
gloomy
satisfaction
in
my
indeed
i
go
so
as
i
myself
while
as
a
species
of
savage
young
wolf
or
other
wild
i
got
wiping
my
sanguinary
at
intervals
and
i
said
can
i
you
and
said
and
i
said
good
afternoon
and
said
same
you
when
i
got
into
courtyard
i
estella
waiting
with
keys
she
asked
me
where
i
why
i
kept
waiting
and
was
a
upon
as
something
instead
of
going
straight
gate
she
stepped
into
and
me
come
you
may
kiss
me
if
you
i
kissed
cheek
as
she
it
me
i
i
would
gone
a
great
kiss
cheek
i
kiss
was
given
coarse
common
as
a
of
money
might
and
it
was
worth
what
with
and
what
with
cards
and
what
with
my
stay
so
when
i
on
spit
of
sand
off
on
marshes
was
gleaming
against
a
and
was
a
of
across
chapter
my
mind
grew
uneasy
on
subject
of
young
gentleman
more
i
of
and
young
gentleman
on
in
stages
of
and
incrimsoned
countenance
more
certain
it
appeared
something
would
me
i
young
gentleman’s
was
on
my
and
would
avenge
it
without
any
idea
of
i
incurred
it
was
clear
me
could
go
stalking
about
country
of
gentlefolks
and
into
studious
youth
of
england
without
open
severe
some
i
even
kept
close
at
and
out
at
kitchen
with
greatest
caution
and
going
on
an
errand
officers
of
county
should
upon
me
young
gentleman’s
stained
my
and
i
wash
out
evidence
of
my
guilt
in
of
i
cut
my
knuckles
against
young
gentleman’s
and
i
my
imagination
into
a
as
i
incredible
ways
of
accounting
circumstance
when
i
should
when
came
my
scene
of
of
my
whether
myrmidons
of
especially
sent
would
in
ambush
gate—whether
miss
an
outrage
might
in
graveclothes
of
a
and
shoot
me
suborned
of
mercenaries—might
engaged
upon
me
in
and
cuff
me
until
i
was
more—it
was
my
confidence
in
spirit
of
young
gentleman
i
imagined
accessory
always
came
into
my
mind
as
acts
of
injudicious
of
goaded
on
state
of
and
an
indignant
sympathy
with
go
miss
i
must
and
go
i
and
came
of
struggle
it
was
alluded
in
any
way
and
young
gentleman
was
on
i
same
gate
open
and
i
explored
garden
and
even
in
at
windows
of
my
was
suddenly
stopped
closed
shutters
within
and
all
was
only
in
corner
where
combat
could
i
any
evidence
of
young
gentleman’s
existence
were
of
gore
in
spot
and
i
covered
with
gardenmould
eye
of
man
on
miss
own
and
other
in
which
was
out
i
saw
a
gardenchair—a
chair
on
wheels
you
it
since
my
and
i
entered
same
on
a
occupation
of
miss
in
chair
when
she
was
of
walking
with
upon
my
shoulder
own
and
across
and
other
over
and
over
and
over
again
we
would
make
and
sometimes
would
as
as
at
a
stretch
i
insensibly
into
a
general
mention
of
as
it
was
at
once
settled
i
should
every
alternate
at
and
i
am
going
sum
up
a
of
at
eight
or
months
as
we
more
used
one
another
miss
more
me
and
asked
me
such
questions
as
what
i
and
what
was
i
going
i
i
was
going
apprenticed
i
and
i
enlarged
upon
my
knowing
and
wanting
know
everything
in
she
might
offer
some
end
she
on
contrary
she
seemed
my
ignorant
she
ever
give
me
any
money—or
anything
my
ever
stipulate
i
should
my
services
estella
was
always
about
and
always
me
in
and
out
me
i
might
kiss
again
sometimes
she
would
coldly
me
sometimes
she
would
condescend
me
sometimes
she
would
quite
with
me
sometimes
she
would
me
energetically
she
me
miss
would
often
ask
me
in
a
whisper
or
when
we
were
alone
she
grow
and
and
when
i
said
yes
indeed
she
would
seem
enjoy
it
greedily
also
when
we
at
cards
miss
would
on
with
a
miserly
of
estella’s
moods
whatever
were
and
sometimes
when
moods
were
so
many
and
so
contradictory
of
one
another
i
was
what
say
or
miss
would
embrace
with
murmuring
something
in
ear
sounded
my
and
and
mercy
was
a
song
used
of
at
of
which
was
old
clem
was
a
ceremonious
way
of
a
saint
i
old
clem
stood
in
smiths
it
was
a
song
imitated
measure
of
upon
iron
and
was
a
mere
excuse
introduction
of
old
clem’s
you
were
clem
with
a
and
a
sound—old
clem
it
out
it
out—old
clem
with
a
clink
stout—old
clem
clem
soaring
clem
one
soon
after
appearance
of
chair
miss
suddenly
saying
me
with
impatient
movement
of
sing
i
was
surprised
into
crooning
as
i
over
it
so
catch
she
it
up
in
a
as
if
she
were
singing
in
sleep
after
it
customary
with
us
it
as
we
moved
about
and
estella
would
often
in
whole
strain
was
so
subdued
even
when
were
of
us
it
made
in
grim
old
of
wind
what
could
i
with
surroundings
could
my
character
influenced

it
wondered
at
if
my

as
my

were
when
i
came
out
into

yellow

into
enormous
inventions
which
i
confessed
under
circumstances
i
could
in
young

an
appropriate
into
coach
i
said
of
shrinking
miss
and
estella
which
come
upon
me
in
grew
much
more
as
went
on
i
complete
confidence
in
one
i
everything
why
it
came
me
so
and
why
a
concern
in
everything

i
know

meanwhile
councils
went
on
in
kitchen
at
with
almost
insupportable
aggravation
my
exasperated
spirit

used
often
come
over
of
a
of

my
sister
and
i
with

would

where
i
was
quiet
in

corner
and
me
as
if

already
i
in

spectacle
of
imbecility
only
equalled
and
my
sister
would
off
in
such
speculations
about
miss
and
about
what
she
would
with
me
and
me
i
used
want—quite
into
spiteful
at
and
all
over

into
opposition

would
at
out
of

and
it
away
was
a
most
irritating
end
every

of
all
in
a
moment
with
up

my
sister
would
stop
in
a
yawn
and
catching

swoop
upon

when
one
miss
stopped
short
as
she
and
i
were
walking

on

at
me
again
and
again
and
after
and
moody
on
of
my
attendance
when
our
usual
exercise
was
over
and
i
at
she
stayed

with
a
movement
of

went
on
in
a
more
alarming
at
any
she
asked
me
and
whether
we
supposed
she
was
under
our
and
we
use
so
and
what
company
we
graciously
she
was
when
she
exhausted
a
of
such
inquiries
she
a
candlestick
at
into
a
sobbing
got

always
a
sign—put
on

cleaned

out

so
we
stood
shivering
in

was
o’clock
at

creep
in
again
and
she
asked
why

carrying
a
great
seal
of

of
a
spare
shawl
and
an
umbrella

quite
clear
whether

of
contented
and
of
aspiring

what
i
wanted
who
can

i
say
when
i
knew
what
i
was
in
some
unlucky
i
at
my
grimiest
and
commonest
should
up
my
eyes
and
see
estella
in
at
one
of
wooden
windows
of

was
she
would
sooner
or
me
out
with
a
and
coarsest
of
my
work
and
would
exult
over
me
and
me
often
after
when
i
was
and
we
were
singing
old
clem
and
when
we
used
sing
it
at
miss
would
seem
show
me
estella’s
in
with
in

and
eyes
scorning
me—often
at
such
a

wooden
windows
were

away
and
would
she
come
at
after

and
meal
would
a
more
ever
and
i
would
more
ashamed
of

in
my

ungracious
chapter
as
i
was
getting
mr

greataunt’s
my
education
under
until

gravity
i
i
questioned
its
merit
except
i
as
i
still
amount
of
somewhat
in
excess
of
in
my
information
i
made
mr
wopsle
some
intellectual
crumbs
upon
me
with
which
kindly
complied
as
it
out
only
wanted
me
a
contradicted
and
embraced
and
wept
over
and
and
clutched
and
stabbed
and
knocked
about

of
ways

until
mr

in
severely
mauled
me
whatever
i
acquired

i
cannot
in
my

unexplained
i
wanted

worthier
of
my
society
and
open
estella’s
old
out
on
marshes
was
our
of
study
and
a
slate
and
a
short

were
our
educational
implements
which
always
added
a
of
i
knew
anything
one
sunday
another
or

under
my
any
of
information
whatever
yet
would
smoke
at
with
a
more
sagacious
air
anywhere
else—even
with
a
air—as
if
considered
advancing
immensely
i
it
was
and
quiet
out
with
sails
on
earthwork
and
sometimes
when
was
as
if
sunken
ships
were
still
sailing
on
at
of
water
whenever
i
watched
standing
out
sea
with
white
sails
spread
i
somehow
of

whenever
struck
aslant
afar
off
upon
a
cloud
or

it
was

everything

and
always

up
with
me
i
was
of
my
knowledge
i
spent
my
guineas
on
it
and
set
aside
greater
of
my
similar
investment
i
i
knew

extremely
at
i
might
as
well
ask
you

when
i
come
in
of
a
any
one

suppose
i
must
catch

cough
said
quietly
and
went
on
with
sewing
my
idea
as
i
in
my
wooden
chair
and
at
sewing
away
with
on
one
side
i
an
extraordinary
girl
i
called
mind
she
was
equally
accomplished
in
of
our
and
of
our
sorts
of
work
and
our
in
short
whatever
i
knew
knew
she
was
already
as
good
a
as
i
or
you
are
one
of
said
i
who
make
most
of
every
chance
you
a
chance
you
came
and
see
improved
you
are
at
me
an
instant
and
went
on
with
sewing
i
was
your
wasn’t
i
said
she
as
she
sewed
i
exclaimed
in
amazement
why
you
are
crying
i
am
said
up
and
what
in
your
what
could
it
in
my
glistening
of
a
as
it
on
work
i
sat
silent
what
a
she
until
mr
wopsle’s
greataunt
successfully
overcame
of
so
got
of
some
i
circumstances
which
she
surrounded
in
miserable
shop
and
miserable
evening
school
with
miserable
old
of
incompetence
always
and
shouldered
i
even
in
untoward
must
in
what
was
in
my
uneasiness
and
i
as
a
matter
of
course
sat
quietly
sewing
shedding
more
and
while
i
at
and
about
it
all
it
occurred
me
i
sufficiently
grateful
i
might
and
should
more
i
use
word
in
my
meditations
with
my
confidence
yes
i
observed
when
i
it
over
you
were
my
and
at
a
when
we
of
ever
in
kitchen
ah
it
was
selfforgetfulness
my
sister
and
get
up
and
about
making
more
comfortable
sadly
well
said
i
we
must
a
more
as
we
used
and
i
must
consult
you
a
more
as
i
used
us
a
quiet
walk
on
marshes
sunday
and
a
chat
my
sister
was
alone
more
undertook
care
of
on
sunday
afternoon
and
and
i
went
out
it
was
summertime
and
weather
when
we
and
church
and
churchyard
and
were
out
on
marshes
and
see
sails
of
ships
as
sailed
on
i
combine
miss
and
estella
with
in
my
usual
way
when
we
came
and
sat
on
with
water
at
our
making
it
all
more
quiet
it
would
without
sound
i
it
was
a
good
and
admission
of
into
my
inner
confidence
said
i
after
secrecy
i
want
a
gentleman
o
i
wouldn’t
if
i
was
you
she
i
it
would
answer
said
i
with
some
severity
i
wanting
a
gentleman
you
know
you
you
are
as
you
are
i
exclaimed
impatiently
i
am
at
all
as
i
am
i
am
with
my
calling
and
with
my
i
either
since
i
was
absurd
was
i
absurd
said
quietly
eyebrows
i
am
sorry
i
mean
i
only
want
you
well
and
comfortable
well
understand
once
all
i
shall
or
can
comfortable—or
anything
miserable—there
i
can
a
sort
of
i
a
said
shaking
with
a
sorrowful
air
i
so
often
it
a
in
singular
kind
of
quarrel
with
myself
which
i
was
always
carrying
on
i
was
inclined
shed
of
and
when
gave
utterance
sentiment
and
my
own
i
she
was
and
i
knew
it
was
much
still
it
was
if
i
could
settled
i
said
up
short
grass
within
much
as
i
once
upon
a
my
out
of
my
and
kicked
into
wall—if
i
could
settled
and
as
of
as
i
was
when
i
was
i
know
it
would
much
me
you
and
i
and
would
wanted
and
and
i
would
gone
when
i
was
out
of
my
and
i
might
even
grown
up
keep
company
with
you
and
we
might
sat
on
on
a
sunday
quite
i
should
good
enough
you
shouldn’t
i
sighed
as
she
at
ships
sailing
on
and
answer
yes
i
am
overparticular
it
scarcely
sounded
i
knew
she
meant
well
instead
of
said
i
up
more
grass
and
chewing
a
or
see
i
am
going
on
and
uncomfortable
and—what
would
it
signify
me
coarse
and
common
if
me
so
suddenly
mine
and
more
attentively
at
me
she
at
sailing
ships
it
was
a
a
say
she
eyes
ships
again
who
said
it
i
was
i
away
without
quite
seeing
where
i
was
going
it
was
shuffled
off
and
i
answered
young
at
miss
and
she’s
more
anybody
ever
was
and
i
admire
and
i
want
a
gentleman
on
account
made
confession
i
my
grass
into
as
if
i
some
of
it
you
want
a
gentleman
spite
or
gain
over
quietly
asked
me
after
a
i
know
i
moodily
answered
if
it
is
spite
i
should
you
know
might
and
more
independently
caring
words
and
if
it
is
gain
over
i
should
you
know
was
worth
gaining
over
exactly
what
i
myself
many
exactly
what
was
manifest
me
at
moment
could
i
a
avoid
wonderful
inconsistency
into
which
and
wisest
of
men
every
it
may
all
quite
said
i
i
admire
in
short
i
over
on
my
when
i
came
and
got
a
good
grasp
on
on
each
side
of
my
and
wrenched
it
well
all
while
knowing
madness
of
my
so
mad
and
misplaced
i
was
quite
conscious
it
would
served
my
if
i
it
up
my
and
knocked
it
against
as
a
such
an
idiot
was
wisest
of
girls
and
she
more
with
me
she
which
was
a
comfortable
work
upon
my
one
after
another
and
gently
out
of
my
she
softly
my
shoulder
in
a
soothing
way
while
with
my
upon
my
sleeve
i
cried
a
as
i
in
yard—and
convinced
i
was
much
illused
somebody
or
everybody
i
can’t
say
which
i
am
glad
of
one
said
and
is
you
you
could
give
me
your
confidence
and
i
am
glad
of
another
and
is
of
course
you
know
you
may
upon
my
keeping
it
and
always
so
it
if
your
such
a
one
and
so
much
in
of
your
at
she
she
knows
what
she
would
set
it
would
a
one
and
you
got
and
it’s
of
use
so
with
a
quiet
sigh
me
and
said
with
a
and
change
of
shall
we
walk
a
or
go
i
cried
getting
up
my
arm
and
giving
a
kiss
i
shall
always
you
everything
you’re
a
gentleman
said
you
know
i
shall
so
always
i
any
occasion
you
anything
you
know
everything
i
know—as
i
you
at
other
ah
said
quite
in
a
whisper
as
she
away
at
ships
and
with
change
shall
we
walk
a
or
go
i
said
we
would
walk
a
and
we
so
and
summer
afternoon
into
summer
evening
and
it
was
i
consider
whether
i
was
more
and
wholesomely
situated
after
all
in
circumstances
my
candlelight
in
with
stopped
clocks
and
estella
i
it
would
good
me
if
i
could
get
out
of
my
with
all
of
and
and
could
go
work
what
i
and
stick
it
and
make
of
it
i
asked
myself
question
whether
i
surely
know
if
estella
were
me
at
moment
instead
of
she
would
make
me
miserable
i
was
obliged
admit
i
know
it
a
certainty
and
i
said
myself
what
a
you
are
we
a
good
as
we
walked
and
all
said
seemed
was
insulting
or
capricious
or
and
somebody
else
she
would
only
and
giving
me
she
would
wounded
own
mine
could
it
i
much
of
said
i
when
we
were
walking
i
wish
you
could
me
i
wish
i
could
said
if
i
could
only
get
myself
in
with
you—you
mind
my
speaking
so
openly
such
an
old
acquaintance
oh
at
all
said
mind
me
if
i
could
only
get
myself
it
would
me
you
will
you
see
said
it
appear
quite
so
unlikely
me
evening
as
it
would
if
we
it
a
i
observed
i
was
quite
sure
of
said
she
was
and
she
said
it
in
my
i
and
yet
i
it
ill
she
should
so
on
when
we
came
churchyard
we
cross
an
embankment
and
get
over
a
stile
a
sluicegate
started
up

or
or

a
general

it
with
a
sharp
and
was
much
against

in
a
whisper

as

a
yell
of

came
slouching
after

at
a
curious

whether
suspected
of
a

murderous
attack
of
which
my
sister
able
give

shall
when

come
into
my
would
and
you

asked
it
was
such
a
question
it
in

manner
occurred
me

me
into
an

at
we
a

and
kneebreeches
who
wiped

interrupted
in
of
go

wait
outside
mike
said

i
i

as
ceremony
as

and
cap
out
after
me
alone
mr
was
a
skylight
only
and
was
a
most
skylight
eccentrically
a
and
adjoining
as
if
at
me
it
were
so
many
about
as
i
should
expected
see
and
were
some
odd
objects
about
i
should
expected
see—such
as
an
old
a
sword
in
a
scabbard
several
strangelooking
and
and
casts
on
a
shelf
of
swollen
and
about

clients
seemed
a
of
up
against
wall
wall
especially
opposite
mr
chair
greasy
with
shoulders
i
oneeyed
gentleman
shuffled
against
wall
when
i
was
innocent
cause
of
out
i
sat
in
cliental
chair
over
against
mr
chair
and
atmosphere
of
i
called
mind
clerk
same
air
of
knowing
something
everybody
else’s
as
master
i
wondered
many
other
clerks
were
upstairs
and
whether
all
claimed
same
mastery
of
i
wondered
what
was
of
all
odd
about
and
it
came
i
wondered
whether
swollen
were
of
mr
and
if
were
so
unfortunate
as
a
of
such
illlooking
why
stuck
on
and
settle
on
instead
of

a
at
of

i
experience
of
a
summer
and
my
spirits
may
oppressed
exhausted
air
and
and
grit
on
everything
i
sat
wondering
and
waiting
in
mr
close
until
i
could
casts
on
shelf
above
mr
chair
and
got
up
and
went
out
when
i
clerk
i
would
a
in
air
while
i
waited
advised
me
go
corner
and
i
should
come
into
smithfield
so
i
came
into
smithfield
and
shameful
all
asmear
with
and
and
and
seemed
stick
me
so
i
it
off
with
all
speed
into
a
street
where
i
saw
great
of
saint

me
a
grim
stone

a
said
was

of

covered
with
straw
of

and
quantity
of

about
smelling
strongly
of
spirits
and
i
inferred
were
on
while

about
me
an
exceedingly
and
minister
of
asked
me
if
i
would
step
in
and
a
or
so
informing

give
me
a
a
crown
whence
i
should
command
a
of
chief
in

and
awful
waxwork
and
offering
at
of
eighteenpence
as

on
of
an

so
good
as

me
where

she
me
as

she
me
on
we
sat
in
among
old
strange
influences
which
so
wrought
upon
me
and
i
she
come
and
she
was
going
and
wilful
as
of
old
she
qualities
into
such
subjection

impossible

out

it
was
impossible
all
wretched
after

and
gentility
my
all
illregulated
aspirations
made

away
in

was
settled
i
should
stay
all

at
and
when
we
conversed
a
while
miss
sent
us
out
walk
in
garden
on
our
coming
in
and
she
said
i
should
wheel
about
a
as
in
of
yore
so
estella
and
i
went
out
into
garden

i
strayed

encounter
with
young
gentleman

in
spirit
and
worshipping
of
she
quite
composed
and
most
worshipping
of
mine
as
we
of

she
stopped
and
said—
i
must
a
singular
creature
and
see
i
and
i
enjoyed
it
much
you
me
much
i
she
in
an
incidental
and
way
i
i
entertained
a
great
objection
your
adversary
i
it
ill

and
i
are
great
are
you

i
you

i
and
she
added
in
a
what

in
my
conscience
i
much
whether

said
estella
with
a
slight
wave
of
signifying
in
air
of
completeness
and
superiority
with
which
she
walked
at
my
side
and
air
of
youthfulness
and
submission
with
which
i
walked
at
made
a
contrast
i
strongly
it
would
in
me
more
it
if
i
myself

eliciting
it
so
set
apart
and
assigned
garden
was
overgrown
and
walking
in
with
ease
and
after
we
made
of
it
or
we
came
out
again
into
yard
i
showed
a
where
i
seen
walking
on
casks

and
she
said
with
a
cold
and
careless
in
i
i
where

come
out
of

given
me
my
meat
and
and
she
said
i
you
made
me
cry
said
i
said
she
and
shook
and
about
i
and
minding
in
made
me
cry
again
inwardly—and
is
sharpest
crying
of
all
you
must
know
said
estella
condescending
me
as
a
and
woman

i
anything
with
my
memory
i
got
some
effect
i
of

knew
could
such

estella

if
it
ceased
i
should
cease
you

what
i
mean
i
softness
what
was

in
upon
my

attentively
at
me

some
of
and

of
miss

wintry
of
chandeliers
in
where
mouldering
was
spread
while
we
were
out
and

was
in

and
waiting
me
it
was

was
under
stronger
enchantment
so
melted
away
our
early
close
at

estella

we
stopped

of
and
miss
with
one
of
withered
arms
stretched
out
of

clenched
upon
yellow
cloth
as
estella
over
shoulder
going
out
at
miss
kissed
with
a
intensity
was
of
its
kind
quite
estella
gone
and
we

adopted
i
and
educated
i
into
what

often
enough
and
could
she
meant
say
it
if
often
word
instead
of
could
sounded
more
a
curse
i’ll
you
said
she
in

whisper
what
is
it
is
unquestioning
selfhumiliation
utter
submission
and
against
yourself
and
against

giving
up
your
whole

smiter—as
i
when
she
came
and

wild
cry
i
caught

curious
it
is
a
curious

so
as
in

sudden
glare
of

it
seemed
while
it
all
alight
and
alive
with
inexplicable
i
and
when
we
were
out
of
it
i
was
as
much
a
moments
as
if
i
in
so
we
into

and
it
was
about
way
which
we
were
and
about
what
of
on

of
it
and
what
on
great
city
was
almost
she
me
she
miss
until
she
gone
and
she
merely
in

and
i
asked
if

emphatically
said

more
it
was
impossible
me
avoid
seeing
she

me
she
made
winning
and
would
won
me
even
if

made
me
even
if

wilfully
chose

and
it
would
wrung
any
in

and
it
away
when
we
i
showed
where

equally
untiring

gentle

quite
unconscious
of

at

we
all
expressed

interest
and
amazement
and
until
again
as

and
miss
skiffins
sat
side

and
as
i
sat
in
a
shadowy
corner
i
observed

and
gradual
elongation
of

suggestive
of
slowly

gradually
stealing

mechanically

quite
enthralling

almost
i

out
and
go

could
until
some
streaks
of
strayed
in
and
showed
me
where
my
whole
interval
whenever
i
went
of
staircase
i
saw
above
and
ceaseless
cry
we
was
of
and
estella
was
it
ever
on
any
similar
occasion
and
were
similar
occasions
of
my
miss
manner
estella
in
anywise
change
except
i
it
something
infused
among
its
characteristics
it
is
impossible
of
my
without
upon
it
or
i
would
gladly
on
a
certain
occasion
when
were
assembled
in
and
when
good
was
in
usual
manner
agreeing
with
anybody
else
called
grove
order
as
mr
yet
a
which
according
solemn
constitution
of
society
it
was
i
i
saw
in
an
ugly
way
at
me
while
were
going
as
was
us
might
easily
what
was
my
indignant
surprise
when
called
upon
company
estella
estella
who
said
i
you
mind
estella
of
where
said
i
you
are
say
of
where
which
was
as
a
of
gentlemen
said
me
out
of
question
and
a
much
knew
about
a
mean
miserable
idiot
i
whispered
i
know
said
across
when
you
said
and
so
i
i
added
with
a
scarlet
you
said
o
was
only
glass
or
crockery—that
creature
was
capable
of
making
i
as
incensed
it
as
if
it
with
wit
and
i
immediately
in
my
and
said
i
could
it
as
impudence
come
grove—we
always
about
coming
grove
as
a
of
expression—down
grove
a
of
whom
knew
mr
upon
starting
up
what
i
meant
whereupon
i
made
extreme
i
knew
where
i
was
whether
it
was
in
a
christian
country
get
on
without
after
was
a
question
on
which
were
upon
it
grew
so
indeed
at
six
more
members
six
more
knew
where
were
it
was
at
grove
a
court
of
if
mr
would
so
slight
a
certificate
importing
of
acquaintance
mr
must
express
as
a
gentleman
and
a
into
a
warmth
which
was
appointed
our
should
cold
and
appeared
with
a
avowal
in
estella’s
she
of
with
several
me
course
i
into
a
warmth
which
and
on
whole
as
untenable
idea
i
was
anywhere
and
i
sat
snorting
at
one
another
an
while
grove
engaged
in
indiscriminate
contradiction
and
of
good
was
gone
ahead
at
an
amazing
i
it
was
me
i
cannot
adequately
express
what
it
gave
me
estella
should
show
any
a
contemptible
clumsy
sulky
so
average
moment
i
it
some
of
generosity
and
in
my
i
could
endure
of
stooping
i
should
miserable
whomsoever
she
a
worthier
object
would
caused
me
a
kind
and
of
it
was
easy
me
out
and
i
soon
out
closely
and
she
allowed
it
a
while
and
was
always
in
of
and
and
i
crossed
one
another
every
on
in
a
way
and
estella
on
with
encouragement
with
almost
openly
knowing
well
scarcely
who
was
spider
as
mr
called
was
used
in
wait
and
of
added
a
confidence
in
money
and
in
greatness
which
sometimes
good
service—almost
of
concentration
and
so
spider
watching
estella
outwatched
many
insects
and
would
often
uncoil
and
at
of
at
a
certain
assembly
at
used
assembly
at
most
where
estella
outshone
all
other
so
about
and
with
so
much
on
i
speak
concerning
i
opportunity
which
was
when
she
was
waiting
mrs
and
was
sitting
apart
among
some
go
i
was
with
i
almost
always
accompanied
and
such
are
you
estella
you
should
say
i
should
i
my
satis
write
i
go
sleep
said
i
surely
a
one
estella
what
you
mean
i
know
any
estella
said
i
at
in
corner
yonder
who
is
over
at
us
why
should
i
at
estella
with
eyes
on
me
instead
what
is
in
in
corner
yonder—to
use
your
words—that
i
at
indeed
is
question
i
want
ask
you
said
i
about
you
all
moths
and
all
sorts
of
ugly
creatures
estella
with
a
glance
about
a
candle
can
candle
it
i
cannot
estella
it
well
said
she
after
a
moment
yes
anything
you
estella
me
speak
it
makes
me
wretched
you
should
encourage
a
man
so
generally
as
you
know
is
well
said
she
you
know
is
as
ungainly
within
as
without
a
illtempered
stupid
well
said
she
you
know
money
and
a
of
addleheaded
you
well
said
she
again
and
each
she
said
it
she
opened
eyes
wider
overcome
of
getting
monosyllable
i
it
and
said
it
with
emphasis
well
is
why
it
makes
me
wretched
if
i
could
she
with
any
idea
of
making
me—me—wretched
i
should
in
about
it
in
way
of
she
me
so
entirely
out
of
question
i
could
of

said
estella
casting
glance
over
about
its
effect
on
you

may
its
effect
on
others

may
meant

estella
suddenly
with

what
a
sense

of
mystery
was
me
when
asleep
of
an
evening
with
knotted
clenching
sides
of
easychair
and
with
wrinkles
on

would
sit

at
wondering
what

with
all
crimes

impulse
was
on

start
up

every
so
increased
my
abhorrence
of

actually
start
out

set
a
man
and

on
ample
was
made
me
quite
as
much
as
and
it
was
a
agreeable
of
us
and
we
must
of
it
was
a
conclusion
quite
established
in
own
mind
comrade
said
after
some
i
know
well
once
since
i
come
a
minute—i’ve
i
said
i
knowed
as
i
you
yourself
on
score
i
ain’t
made
a
gentleman
and
ain’t
agoing
make
you
a
gentleman
me
know
what’s
ye
and
comrade
you
may
count
upon
me
always
a
genteel
muzzle
on
muzzled
i
since
a
minute
when
i
was
into
muzzled
i
am
at
muzzled
i
ever
will
said
certainly
as
if
were
specific
consolation
in
and
and
we
were
anxious
when
would
go
and
us
was
evidently
of
us
and
sat
it
was
midnight
i
essex
street
and
saw
safely
in
at
own
when
it
closed
upon
i
experienced
moment
of
i
known
since
of
arrival
quite
an
uneasy
of
man
on
stairs
i
always
about
me
in
my
guest
out
after
and
in
and
i
about
me
as
it
is
in
a
city
avoid
suspicion
of
watched
when
mind
is
conscious
of
in
i
could
myself
any
of
within
sight
cared
about
my
movements
who
were
on
several
ways
and
street
was
empty
when
i
into
come
out
at
gate
with
us
went
in
at
gate
with
me
as
i
crossed
i
saw
windows
and
quiet
and
when
i
stood
a
moments
in
of
where
i
going
up
stairs
garden
court
was
as
still
and
as
staircase
was
when
i
ascended
it
me
with
open
arms
and
i
so
what
it
is
a
when
spoken
some
sound
words
of
sympathy
and
encouragement
we
sat
consider
question
what
was
chair
occupied
still
where
it
stood—for
a
way
with
of
about
one
spot
in
one
unsettled
manner
and
going
one
of
observances
with
and
and
and
of
cards
and
what
as
if
it
were
all
on
a
slate—i
say
chair
where
it
stood
unconsciously
it
moment
started
out
of
it
it
away
and
another
occasion
say
after
conceived
an
aversion
my
i
occasion
confess
my
own
we
interchanged
confidence
without
shaping
a
syllable
what
said
i
when
was
safe
in
another
chair—what
is
my
i
am
stunned
so
was
i
when
still
something
must
is
intent
upon
expenses—horses
and
carriages
and
appearances
of
all
kinds
must
stopped
somehow

mean
you
can’t
accept—
can

i
interposed
as
of
at
an
involuntary
shudder
over
of
us

i
am
afraid

certainly
opportunity
given

with

accurately
with

and
i
wemmick
in
whether

i
could
say
was
under
some
suspicion
and
my
chambers
watched
wemmick
keeping
close

and
my
keeping
away
and
what
wemmick
said
about
getting
abroad
i
added
of
course
when

i
should
go
with
or
should
close
upon
as
might
safest
in
wemmick’s
what
was
i
upon
indeed
was
i
at
all
clear
or
comfortable
about
it
in
my

i
saw
in
softer
condition
and
in
my
sake
as
altering
my
way
of
enlarging
my
expenses
i
it
whether
in

unsettled

of
safety
with
such
good
who
at
and
said
something
come
into
arising
out
of
wemmick’s
suggestion
which
it
might
worth
while
we
are
good
watermen
and
could
ourselves
when
comes
would
and
would
save
at
a
chance
of

so
confused

out
i
sat
of
it
after
ascended
clouds
in
a
watchcase
and
still
i
could
make
it
out
i

with
a
whirl
of
all
about

soaring
at

as
if

as
submissive
a
word
of
advice
as
if
in
constant
when
we
ashore
get
some

was
stepping
out
i
i
would
safest
where

quietly
sat
again

cold
upon

sunshine
was
cheering

and
all
swung
and
ships
were
advantage
of
get
up
crowd
upon
us
in

and
we
kept
under
shore
as
much
out
of
strength
of
as
we
could
standing
carefully
off
shallows
and
mudbanks
our
oarsmen
were
so
of
occasionally
with
a
minute
or
a
quarter
of
an
as
much
as
wanted
we
got
ashore
among
some
slippery
stones
while
we
ate
and
what
we
with
us
and
about
it
was
my
own
marsh
country
and
monotonous
and
with
a
while
winding
and
and
great
upon
it
and
and
everything
else
seemed
stranded
and
still
of
of
ships
was
we
and
green
strawladen
with
a
sail
and
some
shaped
a
child’s
imitation
of
a
in
mud
and
a
squat
shoallighthouse
on
open
stood
crippled
in
mud
on
stilts
and
crutches
and
slimy
stakes
stuck
out
of

and
slimy
stones
stuck
out
of
mud
and
and
stuck
out
of
mud
and
an
old
and
an
old
slipped
into
mud
and
all
about
us
was
stagnation
and
mud
we
off
again
and
made
what
way
we
could
it
was
much
work
and
startop
and
and
and
until
sun
went
us
a
so
we
could
see
above
was
sun
on
of
shore
in
a
into
and
was
solitary
marsh
and
away
were
grounds
which
and
us
seemed
save
and
in
a
melancholy
gull
as
was
and
as
moon
would
early
we
a
council
a
short
one
clearly
our
course
was
at
we
could
so
oars
once
more
and
i
out
anything
a
we
on
speaking
or
miles
it
was
cold
and
a
collier
coming
us
with
galleyfire
smoking
and
a
comfortable
was
as
as
it
would
until
morning
and
what
we
seemed
come
more
sky
as
oars
in
struck
at
a
stars
at
we
were
evidently
all
idea
we
were
as
made
it
at
irregular
intervals
against

and
whenever
such
a
sound
came
one
or
other
of
us
was
sure
start
and
in
and
set
of
current
worn
into
a
creek
and
we
were
all
suspicious
of
such
and
eyed
sometimes
what
was
one
of
us
would
say
in
a
or
another
is
a
yonder
and
afterwards
we
would
into
a
silence
and
i
would
sit
impatiently
with
what
an
unusual
amount
of
oars
worked
in
at
we
a
and
a
and
afterwards
alongside
a
causeway
made
of
stones
up
in

stepped
ashore
and
in

window
of

went
again
and
we
all
came
ashore

i
of

a
most
unhappy
and
as

who

with
great
cruelty
and
who
quite
as
a
compound
of
avarice
and
meanness
and
i
of
of
an
accident
consequent
on

years
anything
i
knew
she
was
married
again
early
at
me
abundance
of
without
my
with
walk
over
old
spot
what
with
on
way
at
old
objects
and
of
old
quite
when
i
came
was
whatever
wall
of
old
garden
cleared
space
enclosed
with
a
and
over
it
i
saw
some
of
old
ivy
struck
anew
and
was
growing
green
on
quiet
mounds
of
a
gate
in
standing
ajar
i
it
open
and
went
in
a
cold
silvery
mist
afternoon
and
moon
was
yet
up
scatter
it
stars
were
shining
mist
and
moon
was
coming
and
evening
was
i
could
out
where
every
of
old
and
where
and
where
gates
and
where
casks
i
so
and
was
along
garden
walk
when
i
a
solitary
in
it
showed
itself
aware
of
me
as
i
advanced
it
moving
me
it
stood
still
as
i
i
saw
it
of
a
woman
as
i
yet
it
was
about
away
when
it
stopped
and
me
come
up
with
it
it
as
if
much
surprised
and
uttered
my
and
i
cried
out—
estella
i
am
greatly
changed
i
wonder
you
know
me
of
was
indeed
gone
its
indescribable
majesty
and
its
indescribable
charm
attractions
in
it
i
seen
what
i
seen
was
saddened
softened
of
once
eyes
what
i
was
of
once
insensible
we
sat
on
a
was
and
i
said
after
so
many
years
it
is
strange
we
should
meet
again
estella
where
our
meeting
was
you
often
come
i
since
i
moon
and
i
of
at
white
ceiling
which
away

and
i
of
on
my
when
i
spoken
words
on
earth
estella
was
silence
ensued
us
i
often
and
intended
come
many
circumstances
old
silvery
mist
was
with
of
moonlight
and
same
eyes
knowing
i
saw
and
setting
get
of
she
said
quietly—
were
you
wondering
as
you
walked
along
it
came
in
condition
yes
estella

me
it
is
only
i
everything
else

only
i
made
in
all
wretched
years
is
it
on
at
it
is
i
came
of
it
its
change
and
you
she
said
in
a
of
interest
a
wanderer—you
abroad
still
still
and
well
i
am
sure
i
work
a
sufficient
and
i
well
i
often
of
you
said
estella
you
of
often
was
a
when
i
kept
me
of
what
i
away
when
i
was
quite
ignorant
of
its
worth
since
my
incompatible
with
admission
of
i
given
it
a
in
my
you
always
your
in
my
i
answered
and
we
were
silent
again
until
she
spoke
i
said
estella
i
should
of
you
in
of
spot
i
am
glad
so
glad
again
estella
me
is
a
me
of
our
ever
mournful
and
you
said
me
estella
earnestly
you
god
you’
and
if
you
could
say
me
you
will
say
me
when
suffering
stronger
all
other
and
me
understand

as
considerate
and
good
me
as
you
were

me
we
are

i
and
over
as
she
and
will
continue
apart
said
estella
i
in
mine
and
we
went
out
of
and
as
morning

were
