upon

in

a
man
whose
were
and
stiff
and
me
when

i
set
my
and

use
of
my
i
over
my
shoulder
and

way
with
sore
among
great
stones
into
marshes
and
steppingplaces
when
were
or
was
in

a
as
i
stopped
after
and
was
another
so
yet
so
and
sky
was
a
of
angry
and
intermixed
on
edge
of
i
could
make
out
only
in
all
seemed
standing
upright
one
of
was
which
sailors
steered—like
an
unhooped
cask
upon
a
ugly
when
you
were
it
other
a
gibbet
with
some
chains
it
which
once
a
man
was
on
as
if
were
come
and
come
and
going
up
again
it
gave
me
a
when
i
so
and
as
i
saw
cattle
gaze
after
i
wondered
whether
so
i
all
young
man
and
could
see
signs
of
i
was
again
and
without
stopping
chapter
ii
my
sister
mrs
gargery
was
more
years
older
i
and
established
a
great
with
and
she
me
up
at
out
myself
what
expression
meant
and
knowing
a
and
and
much
in
of
it
upon
as
well
as
upon
me
i
supposed
gargery
and
i
were
up
she
was
a
goodlooking
woman
my
sister
and
i
a
general
impression
she
must
made
gargery
marry
was
a
man
with
curls
of
on
each
side
of
smooth
and
with
eyes
of
such
a
undecided
seemed
somehow
got
mixed
with
own
whites
was
a
mild
goodnatured
sweettempered
easygoing
sort
of
in
strength
and
also
in
weakness
my
sister
mrs
with
and
eyes
such
a
of
skin
i
sometimes
used
wonder
whether
it
was
she
washed
with
a
instead
of
soap
she
was
and
and
almost
always
wore
a
coarse
apron
over
with
and
a
square
impregnable
in
was
stuck
of
and
she
made
it
a
merit
in
and
a
strong
against
she
wore
apron
so
much
i
see
why
she
should
worn
it
at
all
or
why
if
she
wear
it
at
all
she
should
it
off
every
of
adjoined
our
which
was
a
wooden
as
many
of
in
our
country
were—most
of
at
when
i

was
shut
up
and

sitting
alone
in

my
my
greater
comfort

when
in

cooperates
with
another

an
eager
and
with
strong
emphasis

with
a
weird
smile

kind
of
in

i
a
sick

some
with
an
impatient
movement
of
of
a
moment
with
of
my
sister’s
working
me

eyes
i
a
idea
of
starting
in
assumed
character
of
mr

i
myself
so
unequal
i
gave
it
up
and
stood
at
miss
in
what
i
suppose
she
a
manner
inasmuch
as
she
said
when
we
a
good
at
each
other—

say
much
or
already
said
it
and
we
another
at
each
other
she
spoke
again

and
at

of

glanced
at
which

absent
and
saw
silk
stocking
on

without
arrest
of
everything
standing
still
of
all
objects
even
withered
on
collapsed

into
a
watchful
and
expression—most
when
all
about
it
as
if

so
she
stooped
and
so
she
spoke

with
a

weight
of
a
crushing
i

quite
confounded
me
and

said
estella
and
and
closed

ask
why

at

if

quiet
estella
and
she
quiet

seemed
me
we
continued
a
in
air
of
and
in
its
corners
i
even
an
alarming
estella
and
i
might
at
coming
out
of
state
in
an
instant
miss
said
me
see
you
cards
why
you
with
we
and
sat
as
i
was
as
and
again
as
miss
watched
us
all
my
attention
estella’s
and
made
me
it
more
on
estella’s
and
estella
me
as
except
she
condescend
speak
when
we
some
games
a
was
appointed
my
and
i
was
into
yard
in
manner
i
was
again
wander
about
as
i
it
is
much
whether
a
gate
in
garden
wall
which
i
scrambled
up
over
on
occasion
was
on
occasion
open
or
shut
enough
i
saw
gate
and
i
saw
one
as
it
stood
open
and
as
i
knew
estella
out—for
she
with
keys
in
strolled
into
garden
and
strolled
all
over
it
it
was
quite
a
wilderness
and
were
old
melonframes
and
cucumberframes
in
it
which
seemed
in
a
spontaneous
growth
of
weak
attempts
at
of
old
and
with
and
a
weedy
offshoot
into
of
a
saucepan
when
i
exhausted
garden
and
a
greenhouse
with
in
it
a
grapevine
and
some
i
myself
in
corner
upon
which
i
out
of
window
questioning
a
moment
was
empty
i
in
at
another
window
and
myself
my
great
surprise
exchanging
a
stare
with
a
young
gentleman
with
eyelids
and
young
gentleman
quickly
and
me
at
when
i
myself
staring
at
and
i
saw
was
inky
said
young
a
general
observation
which
i
usually
observed
answered
itself
i
said
omitting
young
who
you
in
said
miss
estella
who
gave
you
about
miss
estella
come
and
said
young
gentleman
what
could
i
i
often
asked
myself
question
since
what
else
could
i
manner
was
so
and
i
was
so
astonished
i
where
as
if
i
under
a
spell
stop
a
minute
said
wheeling
we
gone
many
i
ought
give
you
a

is
in
a
most
irritating
manner
instantly
slapped
against
one
another
one
of
up
my
slapped
again
and
it
into
my
stomach
mentioned
it
was
unquestionably
in
of
a
was
after
and
meat
i
out
at
and
was
going
out
again
when
said
aha
would
you
and
and
in
a
manner
quite
unparalleled
within
my
experience
of
game
said
skipped
on
skipped
on
come
ground
and
go
and
and
all
sorts
of
while
i
at
i
was
secretly
afraid
of
when
i
saw
so
i
morally
and
convinced
of
could
in
of
my
stomach
and
i
a
consider
it
irrelevant
when
so
obtruded
on
my
attention
i
without
a
word
a
of
garden
of
walls
and
screened
some
on
asking
me
if
i
was
satisfied
with
ground
and
on
my
yes
my
absent
a
moment
and
quickly
with
a
of
water
and
a
sponge
in
available
said
against
wall
and
off
only
and
waistcoat
shirt
in
a
manner
at
once
and
although
on
and
a
out
at
mouth—these
quite
appalled
me
i
about
my
own
age
was
much
and
a
way
of
spinning
about
was
of
appearance
was
a
young
gentleman
in
a
grey
suit
when
with
elbows
knees
wrists
and
considerably
in
advance
of
of
as
my
me
when
i
saw
squaring
at
me
with
every
of
mechanical
and
eyeing
my
anatomy
as
if
were
minutely
choosing
i
so
surprised
in
my
as
i
was
when
i
out
and
saw
on
up
at
me
with
a
and
exceedingly
was
on
and
after
sponging
with
a
great
show
of
squaring
again
second
greatest
surprise
i
ever
in
my
was
seeing
on
again
up
at
me
out
of
a
eye
spirit
inspired
me
with
great
seemed
strength
and
once
me
and
was
always
knocked
would
up
again
in
a
moment
sponging
or
out
of
waterbottle
with
greatest
satisfaction
in
seconding
according
and
came
at
me
with
an
air
and
a
show
made
me
was
going
me
at
got
i
am
sorry
more
i
i
came
up
again
and
again
and
again
until
at
got
a
with
of
against
wall
even
after
crisis
in
our
affairs
got
up
and
and
confusedly
a
knowing
where
i
was
went
on
knees
sponge
and
it
up
at
same
out
means
you
won
seemed
so
and
innocent
although
i
contest
i
a
gloomy
satisfaction
in
my
indeed
i
go
so
as
i
myself
while
as
a
species
of
savage
young
wolf
or
other
wild
i
got
wiping
my
sanguinary
at
intervals
and
i
said
can
i
you
and
said
and
i
said
good
afternoon
and
said
same
you
when
i
got
into
courtyard
i
estella
waiting
with
keys
she
asked
me
where
i
why
i
kept
waiting
and
was
a
upon
as
something
instead
of
going
straight
gate
she
stepped
into
and
me
come
you
may
kiss
me
if
you
i
kissed
cheek
as
she
it
me
i
i
would
gone
a
great
kiss
cheek
i
kiss
was
given
coarse
common
as
a
of
money
might
and
it
was
worth
what
with
and
what
with
cards
and
what
with
my
stay
so
when
i
on
spit
of
sand
off
on
marshes
was
gleaming
against
a
and
was
a
of
across
chapter
my
mind
grew
uneasy
on
subject
of
young
gentleman
more
i
of
and
young
gentleman
on
in
stages
of
and
incrimsoned
countenance
more
certain
it
appeared
something
would
me
i
young
gentleman’s
was
on
my
and
would
avenge
it
without
any
idea
of
i
incurred
it
was
clear
me
could
go
stalking
about
country
of
gentlefolks
and
into
studious
youth
of
england
without
open
severe
some
i
even
kept
close
at
and
out
at
kitchen
with
greatest
caution
and
going
on
an
errand
officers
of
county
should
upon
me
young
gentleman’s
stained
my
and
i
wash
out
evidence
of
my
guilt
in
of
i
cut
my
knuckles
against
young
gentleman’s
and
i
my
imagination
into
a
as
i
incredible
ways
of
accounting
circumstance
when
i
should
when
came
my
scene
of
of
my
whether
myrmidons
of
especially
sent
would
in
ambush
gate—whether
miss
an
outrage
might
in
graveclothes
of
a
and
shoot
me
suborned
of
mercenaries—might
engaged
upon
me
in
and
cuff
me
until
i
was
more—it
was
my
confidence
in
spirit
of
young
gentleman
i
imagined
accessory
always
came
into
my
mind
as
acts
of
injudicious
of
goaded
on
state
of
and
an
indignant
sympathy
with
go
miss
i
must
and
go
i
and
came
of
struggle
it
was
alluded
in
any
way
and
young
gentleman
was
on
i
same
gate
open
and
i
explored
garden
and
even
in
at
windows
of
my
was
suddenly
stopped
closed
shutters
within
and
all
was
only
in
corner
where
combat
could
i
any
evidence
of
young
gentleman’s
existence
were
of
gore
in
spot
and
i
covered
with
gardenmould
eye
of
man
on
miss
own
and
other
in
which
was
out
i
saw
a
gardenchair—a
chair
on
wheels
you
it
since
my
and
i
entered
same
on
a
occupation
of
miss
in
chair
when
she
was
of
walking
with
upon
my
shoulder
own
and
across
and
other
over
and
over
and
over
again
we
would
make
and
sometimes
would
as
as
at
a
stretch
i
insensibly
into
a
general
mention
of
as
it
was
at
once
settled
i
should
every
alternate
at
and
i
am
going
sum
up
a
of
at
eight
or
months
as
we
more
used
one
another
miss
more
me
and
asked
me
such
questions
as
what
i
and
what
was
i
going
i
i
was
going
apprenticed
i
and
i
enlarged
upon
my
knowing
and
wanting
know
everything
in
she
might
offer
some
end
she
on
contrary
she
seemed
my
ignorant
she
ever
give
me
any
money—or
anything
my
ever
stipulate
i
should
my
services
estella
was
always
about
and
always
me
in
and
out
me
i
might
kiss
again
sometimes
she
would
coldly
me
sometimes
she
would
condescend
me
sometimes
she
would
quite
with
me
sometimes
she
would
me
energetically
she
me
miss
would
often
ask
me
in
a
whisper
or
when
we
were
alone
she
grow
and
and
when
i
said
yes
indeed
she
would
seem
enjoy
it
greedily
also
when
we
at
cards
miss
would
on
with
a
miserly
of
estella’s
moods
whatever
were
and
sometimes
when
moods
were
so
many
and
so
contradictory
of
one
another
i
was
what
say
or
miss
would
embrace
with
murmuring
something
in
ear
sounded
my
and
and
mercy
was
a
song
used
of
at
of
which
was
old
clem
was
a
ceremonious
way
of
a
saint
i
old
clem
stood
in
smiths
it
was
a
song
imitated
measure
of
upon
iron
and
was
a
mere
excuse
introduction
of
old
clem’s
you
were
clem
with
a
and
a
sound—old
clem
it
out
it
out—old
clem
with
a
clink
stout—old
clem
clem
soaring
clem
one
soon
after
appearance
of
chair
miss
suddenly
saying
me
with
impatient
movement
of
sing
i
was
surprised
into
crooning
as
i
over
it
so
catch
she
it
up
in
a
as
if
she
were
singing
in
sleep
after
it
customary
with
us
it
as
we
moved
about
and
estella
would
often
in
whole
strain
was
so
subdued
even
when
were
of
us
it
made
in
grim
old
of
wind
what
could
i
with
surroundings
could
my
character
influenced
is
it
wondered
at
if
my
were
as
my
eyes
were
when
i
came
out
into
misty
yellow
i
might
about
young
gentleman
if
i
into
enormous
inventions
which
i
confessed
under
circumstances
i
could
in
young
gentleman
an
appropriate
into
coach
i
said
of
shrinking
miss
and
estella
which
come
upon
me
in
grew
much
more
as
went
on
i
complete
confidence
in
one
i
everything
why
it
came
me
so
and
why
a
concern
in
everything
i
i
know
i
i
know
meanwhile
councils
went
on
in
kitchen
at
with
almost
insupportable
aggravation
my
exasperated
spirit
ass
used
often
come
over
of
a
of
my
with
my
sister
and
i
with
i
ought
if
could
a
out
of

would
it
miserable
man
was
a
man
of
confined
stolidity
of
mind
could
my
without
me

were
operate
upon—and
would
me
up
my
stool
usually
collar
where
i
was
quiet
in
a
corner
and
me
as
if
i
were
going
cooked
would
saying
mum

which
you
up
up

grateful

would

wrong
way—which
my
earliest
as
already
i
in
my
soul
of
any
would
me
sleeve—a
spectacle
of
imbecility
only
equalled
and
my
sister
would
off
in
such
speculations
about
miss
and
about
what
she
would
with
me
and
me
i
used
want—quite
into
spiteful
at
and
all
over
in
my
sister
spoke
me
as
if
she
were
morally
wrenching
one
of
my
out
at
every
while

was
old
enough
apprenticed
and
when
sat
with
on
knees
out

my
sister
would
so
construe
innocent
action
into
opposition
on
she
would
at
out
of
shake
and
it
away
was
a
most
irritating
end
every
one
of
all
in
a
moment
with
up
it
my
sister
would
stop
in
a
yawn
and
catching
sight
of
me
as
it
were
incidentally
would
swoop
upon
me
with
come
enough
of
you

as
if
i
as
a
my
out
we
went
on
in
way
a
and
it
seemed
we
should
continue
go
on
in
way
a
when
one
miss
stopped
short
as
she
and
i
were
walking
she
on
my
shoulder
and
said
with
some
you

of

said
more

stopped
and
at
me
again
and
again
and
after
and
moody
on
of
my
attendance
when
our
usual
exercise
was
over
and
i
at
she
stayed
me
with
a
movement
of
impatient
me
again
of
of

when

my
sister
went
on
in
a
more
alarming
at
any
she
asked
me
and
whether
we
supposed
she
was
under
our
and
we
use
so
and
what
company
we
graciously
she
was
when
she
exhausted
a
of

of
contented
and
of
aspiring

what
i
wanted
who
can
say

i
say
when
i
knew
what
i
was
in
some
unlucky
i
at
my
grimiest
and
commonest
should
up
my
eyes
and
see
estella
in
at
one
of
wooden
windows
of

was
she
would
sooner
or
me
out
with
a
and
coarsest
of
my
work
and
would
exult
over
me
and
me
often
after
when
i
was
and
we
were
singing
old
clem
and
when
we
used
sing
it
at
miss
would
seem
show
me
estella’s
in
with
in

and
eyes
scorning
me—often
at
such
a

would
of
in

wooden
windows
were

i
saw
away
and
would
she
come
at
after

we
went
in
supper
and
meal
would
a
more
ever
and
i
would
more
ashamed
of
ever
in
my

ungracious
chapter
as
i
was
getting
mr
wopsle’s
greataunt’s
my
education
under
until

gravity
i
i
questioned
its
merit
except
i
as
i
still
amount
of
somewhat
in
excess
of
in
my
information
i
made
mr
wopsle
some
intellectual
crumbs
upon
me
with
which
kindly
complied
as
it
out
only
wanted
me
a
contradicted
and
embraced
and
wept
over
and
and
clutched
and
stabbed
and
knocked
about

a
of
ways

until
mr

in
severely
mauled
me
whatever
i
acquired

so
well
i
cannot
in
my
conscience

might
worthier
of
my
society
and
open
estella’s
old
out
on
marshes

our
of
study
and
a

our
educational
implements

always
added
a
of

knew
anything
one
sunday
another
or

under
my
any
of
information
whatever
yet
would
smoke
at
with
a
more
sagacious
air
anywhere
else—even
with
a
air—as
if
considered
advancing
immensely
i
it
was
and
quiet
out
with
sails
on
earthwork
and
sometimes
when
was
as
if
sunken
ships
were
still
sailing
on
at
of
water
whenever
i
watched
standing
out
sea
with
white
sails
spread
i
somehow
of

whenever
struck
aslant
afar
off
upon
a
cloud

it
was

she
with
us
more
a
year
i
out
of
mourning
at

struck
me
when
i
observed
myself
one
evening
she
curiously
and
attentive
eyes

were
and
good
it
came
of
my
up
my
own
eyes
a
i
was
at—writing
some
a

myself
in
ways
at

a
sort
of
stratagem—and
seeing
observant
of
what
i
was
about

stopped
in

said
i
you

up
with
me

knowledge
i
spent
my
guineas
on

and
set
aside
greater
of
my
similar
investment
i
i
knew
was
extremely
at
i
might
as
well
ask
you

when
i
come
in
of
a
any
one

see
me
at

you
at

i
must
catch
it
a
cough
said
quietly
and
went
on
with
sewing
my
idea
as
i
in
my
wooden
chair
and
at
sewing
away
with
on
one
side
i
an
extraordinary
girl
i
called
mind
she
was
equally
accomplished
in
of
our
and
of
our
sorts
of
work
and
our
in
short
whatever
i
knew
knew
she
was
already
as
good
a
as
i
or
you
are
one
of
said
i
who
make
most
of
every
chance
you
a
chance
you
came
and
see
improved
you
are
at
me
an
instant
and
went
on
with
sewing
i
was
your
wasn’t
i
said
she
as
she
sewed
i
exclaimed
in
amazement
why
you
are
crying
i
am
said
up
and
what
in
your
what
could
it
in
my
glistening
of
a
as
it
on
work
i
sat
silent
what
a
she
until
mr
wopsle’s
greataunt
successfully
overcame
of
so
got
of
some
i
circumstances
which
she
surrounded
in
miserable
shop
and
miserable
evening
school
with
miserable
old
of
incompetence
always
and
shouldered
i
even
in
untoward
must
in
what
was
in
my
uneasiness
and
i
as
a
matter
of
course
sat
quietly
sewing
shedding
more
and
while
i
at
and
about
it
all
it
occurred
me
i
sufficiently
grateful
i
might
and
should
more
i
use
word
in
my
meditations
with
my
confidence
yes
i
observed
when
i
it
over
you
were
my
and
at
a
when
we
of
ever
in
kitchen
ah
it
was
selfforgetfulness
my
sister
and
get
up
and
about
making
more
comfortable
sadly
well
said
i
we
must
a
more
as
we
used
and
i
must
consult
you
a
more
as
i
used
us
a
quiet
walk
on
marshes
sunday
and
a
chat
my
sister
was
alone
more
undertook
care
of
on
sunday
afternoon
and
and
i
went
out
it
was
summertime
and
weather
when
we
and
church
and
churchyard
and
were
out
on
marshes
and
see
sails
of
ships
as
sailed
on
i
combine
miss
and
estella
with
in
my
usual
way
when
we
came
and
sat
on
with
water
at
our
making
it
all
more
quiet
it
would
without
sound
i
it
was
a
good
and
admission
of
into
my
inner
confidence
said
i
after
secrecy
i
want
a
gentleman
o
i
wouldn’t
if
i
was
you
she
i
it
would
answer
said
i
with
some
severity
i
wanting
a
gentleman
you
know
you
you
are
as
you
are
i
exclaimed
impatiently
i
am
at
all
as
i
am
i
am
with
my
calling
and
with
my
i
either
since
i
was
absurd
was
i
absurd
said
quietly
eyebrows
i
am
sorry
i
mean
i
only
want
you
well
and
comfortable
well
understand
once
all
i
shall
or
can
comfortable—or
anything
miserable—there
i
can
a
sort
of
i
a
said
shaking
with
a
sorrowful
air
i
so
often
it
a
in
singular
kind
of
quarrel
with
myself
which
i
was
always
carrying
on
i
was
inclined
shed
of
and
when
gave
utterance
sentiment
and
my
own
i
she
was
and
i
knew
it
was
much
still
it
was
if
i
could
settled
i
said
up
short
grass
within
much
as
i
once
upon
a
my
out
of
my
and
kicked
into
wall—if
i
could
settled
and
as
of
as
i
was
when
i
was
i
know
it
would
much
me
you
and
i
and
would
wanted
and
and
i
would
gone
when
i
was
out
of
my
and
i
might
even
grown
up
keep
company
with
you
and
we
might
sat
on
on
a
sunday
quite
i
should
good
enough
you
shouldn’t
i
sighed
as
she
at
ships
sailing
on
and
answer
yes
i
am
overparticular
it
scarcely
sounded
i
knew
she
meant
well
instead
of
said
i
up
more
grass
and
chewing
a
or
see
i
am
going
on
and
uncomfortable
and—what
would
it
signify
me
coarse
and
common
if
me
so
suddenly
mine
and
more
attentively
at
me
she
at
sailing
ships
it
was
a
a
say
she
eyes
ships
again
who
said
it
i
was
i
away
without
quite
seeing
where
i
was
going
it
was
shuffled
off
and
i
answered
young
at
miss
and
she’s
more
anybody
ever
was
and
i
admire
and
i
want
a
gentleman
on
account
made
confession
i
my
grass
into
as
if
i
some
of
it
you
want
a
gentleman
spite
or
gain
over
quietly
asked
me
after
a
i
know
i
moodily
answered
if
it
is
spite
i
should
you
know
might
and
more
independently
caring
words
and
if
it
is
gain
over
i
should
you
know
was
worth
gaining
over
exactly
what
i
myself
many
exactly
what
was
manifest
me
at
moment
could
i
a
avoid
wonderful
inconsistency
into
which
and
wisest
of
men
every
it
may
all
quite
said
i
i
admire
in
short
i
over
on
my
when
i
came
and
got
a
good
grasp
on
on
each
side
of
my
and
wrenched
it
well
all
while
knowing
madness
of
my
so
mad
and
misplaced
i
was
quite
conscious
it
would
served
my
if
i
it
up
my
and
knocked
it
against
as
a
such
an
idiot
was
wisest
of
girls
and
she
more
with
me
she
which
was
a
comfortable
work
upon
my
one
after
another
and
gently
out
of
my
she
softly
my
shoulder
in
a
soothing
way
while
with
my
upon
my
sleeve
i
cried
a
as
i
in
yard—and
convinced
i
was
much
illused
somebody
or
everybody
i
can’t
say
which
i
am
glad
of
one
said
and
is
you
you
could
give
me
your
confidence
and
i
am
glad
of
another
and
is
of
course
you
know
you
may
upon
my
keeping
it
and
always
so
it
if
your
such
a
one
and
so
much
in
of
your
at
she
she
knows
what
she
would
set
it
would
a
one
and
you
got
and
it’s
of
use
so
with
a
quiet
sigh
me
and
said
with
a
and
change
of
shall
we
walk
a
or
go
i
cried
getting
up
my
arm
and
giving
a
kiss
i
shall
always
you
everything
you’re
a
gentleman
said
you
know
i
shall
so
always
i
any
occasion
you
anything
you
know
everything
i
know—as
i
you
at
other
ah
said
quite
in
a
whisper
as
she
away
at
ships
and
with
change
shall
we
walk
a
or
go
i
said
we
would
walk
a
and
we
so
and
summer
afternoon
into
summer
evening
and
it
was
i
consider
whether
i
was
more
and
wholesomely
situated
after
all
in
circumstances
my
candlelight
in
with
stopped
clocks
and
estella
i
it
would
good
me
if
i
could
get
out
of
my
with
all
of
and
and
could
go
work
what
i
and
stick
it
and
make
of
it
i
asked
myself
question
whether
i
surely
know
if
estella
were
me
at
moment
instead
of
she
would
make
me
miserable
i
was
obliged
admit
i
know
it
a
certainty
and
i
said
myself
what
a
you
are
we
a
good
as
we
walked
and
all
said
seemed
was
insulting
or
capricious
or
and
somebody
else
she
would
only
and
giving
me
she
would
wounded
own
mine
could
it
i
much
of
said
i
when
we
were
walking
i
wish
you
could
me
i
wish
i
could
said
if
i
could
only
get
myself
in
with
you—you
mind
my
speaking
so
openly
such
an
old
acquaintance
oh
at
all
said
mind
me
if
i
could
only
get
myself
it
would
me
you
will
you
see
said
it
appear
quite
so
unlikely
me
evening
as
it
would
if
we
it
a
i
observed
i
was
quite
sure
of
said
she
was
and
she
said
it
in
my
i
and
yet
i
it
ill
she
should
so
on
when
we
came
churchyard
we
cross
an
embankment
and
get
over
a
stile
a
sluicegate
started
up
gate
or
or
ooze
which
was
quite
in

old
orlick
growled
where

an
idea
of

savagely
when
i
was
younger
i
a
general
if
me
would
it
with
a
sharp
and
was
much
against
going
with
us
and
said
me
in
a
whisper
come
i
as
i
either
i
of
saying
we
we
want

with
a
yell
of

came
slouching
after
us
at
a
curious
know
whether
suspected
of
a
in
murderous
attack
of
which
my
sister
able
give
any
account
i
asked
why

over

me
into
an

interrupted
in
of
go

as

out
after
me
alone
mr
was
a
skylight
only
and
was
a
most
skylight
eccentrically
a
and
adjoining
as
if
at
me
it
were
so
many
about
as
i
should
expected
see
and
were
some
odd
objects
about
i
should
expected

as
an
old
a

in
a
scabbard
several
strangelooking
and
and
casts
on

a
of
up
against
wall
wall
especially
opposite
mr

greasy
with

i
oneeyed
gentleman
shuffled
against

when
i
was
innocent
cause
of
out
i
sat
in
cliental
chair
over
against
mr

and
atmosphere
of
i
called
mind
clerk
same
air
of
knowing
something
everybody
else’s
as
master
i
wondered
many
other
clerks
were
upstairs
and
whether
all
claimed

mastery
of

wondered
what
was
of
all
odd
about
and
it
came
i
wondered
whether
swollen
were
of
mr
and
if
were
so
unfortunate
as
a
of
such
illlooking
why
stuck
on
and
settle
on

at
of

i
experience
of
a
summer
and
my
spirits
may
oppressed
exhausted
air
and
and
grit
on
everything
i
sat
wondering
and
waiting
in
mr
close
until
i
could
casts
on
shelf
above
mr
chair
and
got
up
and
went
out
when

i
came
into

all
asmear
with

and
and
seemed
stick
me
so
i
it
off
with
all
speed
into
a
street
where
i
saw

a
said

and
quantity
of

about
smelling
strongly
of

me
if

would
step
in

whence
i
should

at
of

on
of
an

so
good
as

me
where

came
upon

and
inaccessibility

and
insulting
and
you
wanted

and
estella
smiled
with
composure
and
said
she
of
my
quite
and
of
is
changed
miss
asked
much
said
estella
at
me
coarse
and
common
said
miss
with
estella’s
estella
and
at
shoe
in
and
again
and
at
me
and
shoe
she
me
as
a
still
she
me
on
we
sat
in
among
old
strange
influences
which
so
wrought
upon
me
and
i
she
come
and
she
was
going
and
wilful
as
of
old
she
qualities
into
such
subjection
it
was
impossible
and
out
of
i
so—to
separate
it
was
impossible
all
wretched
after
money
and
gentility
my
all
illregulated
aspirations
made
me
ashamed
of
and
all
in
glowing
struck
it
out
of
iron
on
anvil
extracted
it
of
in
at
wooden
window
of
and
away
in
a
word
it
was
impossible
me
separate
in
or
in
innermost
of
my
it
was
settled
i
should
stay
all
of
and
at
and
when
we
conversed
a
while
miss
sent
us
out
walk
in
garden
on
our
coming
in
and
she
said
i
should
wheel
about
a
as
in
of
yore
so
estella
and
i
went
out
into
garden
gate
which
i
strayed
my
encounter
with
young
gentleman
i
in
spirit
and
worshipping
of
she
quite
composed
and
most
worshipping
of
mine
as
we
of
encounter
she
stopped
and
said—
i
must
a
singular
creature
and
see
i
and
i
enjoyed
it
much
you
me
much
i
she
in
an
incidental
and
way
i
i
entertained
a
great
objection
your
adversary
i
it
ill
should
me
with
company
and
i
are
great
are
you
i
i
you
with
yes
i
made
admission
with
it
seemed
a
and
she
already
me
more
enough
a
since
your
change
of
and
you
changed
your
companions
said
estella
said
i
and
she
added
in
a
what
was
company
you
once
would
quite
unfit
company
you
in
my
conscience
i
much
whether
i
any
intention
of
going
see
if
i
observation
it
you
idea
of
your
impending
good
in
said
estella
with
a
slight
wave
of
signifying
in
air
of
completeness
and
superiority
with
which
she
walked
at
my
side
and
air
of
youthfulness
and
submission
with
which
i
walked
at
made
a
contrast
i
strongly
it
would
in
me
more
it
if
i
myself
as
eliciting
it
so
set
apart
and
assigned
garden
was
overgrown
and
walking
in
with
ease
and
after
we
made
of
it
or
we
came
out
again
into
yard
i
showed
a
where
i
seen
walking
on
casks
old
and
she
said
with
a
cold
and
careless
in
i
i
where
she
come
out
of
and
given
me
my
meat
and
and
she
said
i
you
made
me
cry
said
i
said
she
and
shook
and
about
i
and
minding
in
made
me
cry
again
inwardly—and
is
sharpest
crying
of
all
you
must
know
said
estella
condescending
me
as
a
and
woman
might
i
anything
with
my
memory
i
got
some
effect
i
of
i
knew
could
such
without
it
oh
i
a
stabbed
in
or
shot
in
i
said
estella
and
of
course
if
it
ceased
i
should
cease
you
know
what
i
mean
i
softness
what
was
it
was
in
upon
my
mind
when
she
stood
still
and
attentively
at
me
anything
i
seen
in
miss
in
some
of
and
gestures
was
of
miss
which
may
often
acquired

grown
with
whom
much
associated
and
secluded
and
which
when

occasional
of
expression

otherwise
quite
and
yet
i
could
miss

at
once
imperiously

wintry
of
chandeliers
in
where
mouldering
was
spread
while
we
were
out
and

was
under
stronger
enchantment

melted
away
our
early
close
at

estella

we
stopped

of
and
miss
with
one
of
withered
arms
stretched
out
of

clenched
upon
yellow
cloth
as
estella
over
shoulder
going
out
at
miss
kissed
with
a
intensity

of
its
kind
quite
estella

it
if
often

instead
of
could
sounded
more
a
curse
i’ll

said
she
in

whisper
what
is

unquestioning
selfhumiliation
utter
submission
and
against

i
when

all
in

so
as
in

street
if
we
come
into
a
sudden
glare
of

it
seemed
while
it
all
alight
and
alive
with
inexplicable
i
and
when
we
were
out
of

i
was
as
much
a
moments
as
if
i
in
so
we
into

and
it
was
about

which
we
were

about
what

and
what
on
great
city
was
almost
she
me
she
miss
until
she
gone
and
she
merely
in

i
asked
if

impossible
me
avoid

it
away
when

make
me
miss
settled
i
knew
upon
among
with
which
it
was
strewn
i
advantage
of
moment—i
sought
one
after
estella’s
attention
with
a
movement
of
my
when
i
estella
was
yet
standing
great
chimneypiece
as
she
stood
miss
grey
was
all
adrift
upon
ground
among
other
wrecks
and
was
a
miserable
sight
see
it
was
with
a
i
walked
in
starlight
an
and
more
about
courtyard
and
about
and
about
garden
when
i
at
courage
i
estella
sitting
at
miss
knee
up
some
stitches
in
one
of
old
articles
of
were
and
of
which
i
often
since
of
old
i
seen
up
in
cathedrals
afterwards
estella
and
i
at
cards
as
of
yore—only
we
were
skilful
and
games—and
so
evening
wore
away
and
i
went
i
in
separate
across
courtyard
it
was
i
ever
in
satis
and
sleep
come
me
a
miss
me
she
was
on
side
of
my
on
at
of
at
of
in
in
overhead
in
at
when
was
slow
creep
on
o’clock
i
i
absolutely
could
as
a
in
and
i
must
get
up
i
got
up
and
on
my
clothes
and
went
out
across
yard
into
stone
gain
outer
courtyard
and
walk
of
my
mind
i
was
sooner
in
i
extinguished
my
candle
i
saw
miss
going
along
it
in
a
ghostly
manner
making
a
cry
i
at
a
and
saw
go
up
staircase
she
carried
a
candle
in
which
she
one
of
sconces
in
own
and
was
a
most
unearthly
object
its
standing
at
of
staircase
i
mildewed
air
of
without
seeing
open
and
i
walking
and
so
across
into
own
and
so
across
again
into
ceasing
cry
after
a
i
in
get
out
and
go
i
could
until
some
streaks
of
strayed
in
and
showed
me
where
my
whole
interval
whenever
i
went
of
staircase
i
saw
above
and
ceaseless
cry
we
was
of
and
estella
was
it
ever
on
any
similar
occasion
and
were
similar
occasions
of
my
miss
manner
estella
in
anywise
change
except
i
it
something
infused
among
its
characteristics
it
is
impossible
of
my
without
upon
it
or
i
would
gladly
on
a
certain
occasion
when
were
assembled
in
and
when
good
was
in
usual
manner
agreeing
with
anybody
else
called
grove
order
as
mr
yet
a
which
according
solemn
constitution
of
society
it
was
i
i
saw
in
an
ugly
way
at
me
while
were
going
as
was
us
might
easily
what
was
my
indignant
surprise
when
called
upon
company
estella
estella
who
said
i
you
mind
estella
of
where
said
i
you
are
say
of
where
which
was
as
a
of
gentlemen
said
me
out
of
question
and
a
much
knew
about
a
mean
miserable
idiot
i
whispered
i
know
said
across
when
you
said
and
so
i
i
added
with
a
scarlet
you
said
o
was
only
glass
or
crockery—that
creature
was
capable
of
making
i
as
incensed
it
as
if
it
with
wit
and
i
immediately
in
my
and
said
i
could
it
as
impudence
come
grove—we
always
about
coming
grove
as
a
of
expression—down
grove
a
of
whom
knew
mr
upon
starting
up
what
i
meant
whereupon
i
made
extreme
i
knew
where
i
was
whether
it
was
in
a
christian
country
get
on
without
after
was
a
question
on
which
were
upon
it
grew
so
indeed
at
six
more
members
six
more
knew
where
were
it
was
at
grove
a
court
of
if
mr
would
so
slight
a
certificate
importing
of
acquaintance
mr
must
express
as
a
gentleman
and
a
into
a
warmth
which
was
appointed
our
should
cold
and
appeared
with
a
avowal
in
estella’s
she
of
with
several
me
course
i
into
a
warmth
which
and
on
whole
as
untenable
idea
i
was
anywhere
and
i
sat
snorting
at
one
another
an
while
grove
engaged
in
indiscriminate
contradiction
and
of
good
was
gone
ahead
at
an
amazing
i
it
was
me
i
cannot
adequately
express
what
it
gave
me
estella
should
show
any
a
contemptible
clumsy
sulky
so
average
moment
i
it
some
of
generosity
and
in
my
i
could
endure
of
stooping
i
should
miserable
whomsoever
she
a
worthier
object
would
caused
me
a
kind
and
of
it
was
easy
me
out
and
i
soon
out
closely
and
she
allowed
it
a
while
and
was
always
in
of
and
and
i
crossed
one
another
every
on
in
a
way
and
estella
on
with
encouragement
with
almost
openly
knowing
well
scarcely
who
was
spider
as
mr
called
was
used
in
wait
and
of
added
a
confidence
in
money
and
in
greatness
which
sometimes
good
service—almost
of
concentration
and
so
spider
watching
estella
outwatched
many
insects
and
would
often
uncoil
and
at
of
at
a
certain
assembly
at
used
assembly
at
most
where
estella
outshone
all
other
so
about
and
with
so
much
on
i
speak
concerning
i
opportunity
which
was
when
she
was
waiting
mrs
and
was
sitting
apart
among
some
go
i
was
with
i
almost
always
accompanied
and
such
are
you
estella
you
should
say
i
should
i
my
satis
write
i
go
sleep
said
i
surely
a
one
estella
what
you
mean
i
know
any
estella
said
i
at
in
corner
yonder
who
is
over
at
us
why
should
i
at
estella
with
eyes
on
me
instead
what
is
in
in
corner
yonder—to
use
your
words—that
i
at
indeed
is
question
i
want
ask
you
said
i
about
you
all
moths
and
all
sorts
of
ugly
creatures
estella
with
a
glance
about
a
candle
can
candle
it
i
cannot
estella
it
well
said
she
after
a
moment
yes
anything
you
estella
me
speak
it
makes
me
wretched
you
should
encourage
a
man
so
generally
as
you
know
is
well
said
she
you
know
is
as
ungainly
within
as
without
a
illtempered
stupid
well
said
she
you
know
money
and
a
of
addleheaded
you
well
said
she
again
and
each
she
said
it
she
opened
eyes
wider
overcome
of
getting
monosyllable
i
it
and
said
it
with
emphasis
well
is
why
it
makes
me
wretched
if
i
could
she
with
any
idea
of
making
me—me—wretched
i
should
in
about
it
in
way
of
she
me
so
entirely
out
of
question

over
about

when
i
got
of

i
it
well
without

me
with
a

what
a

of
mystery

me
when
asleep
of
an
evening
with
knotted
clenching
sides
of
easychair

with
wrinkles
on

would
sit

at
wondering
what

was
on

up

every
so
increased
my
abhorrence

of
when
and
i
and

and
i
whole
of
secret
enough
i
saw
my
own
in
and
among
my
man
who
so
much
me
what
would
alone
set
a
man
and
us
if

good
made
me
a
gentleman
and
come

me
support
character
on
ample
was
made
me
quite
as
much
as
and
it
was
a
agreeable
of
us
and
we
must
of
it
was
a
conclusion
quite
established
in
own
mind
comrade
said
after
some
i
know
well
once
since
i
come
a
minute—i’ve
i
said
i
knowed
as
i
you
yourself
on
score
i
ain’t
made
a
gentleman
and
ain’t
agoing
make
you
a
gentleman
me
know
what’s
ye
and
comrade
you
may
count
upon
me
always
a
genteel
muzzle
on
muzzled
i
since
a
minute
when
i
was
into
muzzled
i
am
at
muzzled
i
ever
will
said
certainly
as
if
were
specific
consolation
in
and
and
we
were
anxious
when
would
go
and
us
was
evidently
of
us
and
sat
it
was
midnight
i
essex
street
and
saw
safely
in
at
own
when
it
closed
upon
i
experienced
moment
of
i
known
since
of
arrival
quite
an
uneasy
of
man
on
stairs
i
always
about
me
in
my
guest
out
after
and
in
and
i
about
me
as
it
is
in
a
city
avoid
suspicion
of
watched
when
mind
is
conscious
of
in
i
could
myself
any
of
within
sight
cared
about
my
movements
who
were
on
several
ways
and
street
was
empty
when
i
into
come
out
at
gate
with
us
went
in
at
gate
with
me
as
i
crossed
i
saw
windows
and
quiet
and
when
i
stood
a
moments
in
of
where
i
going
up
stairs
garden
court
was
as
still
and
as
staircase
was
when
i
ascended
it
me
with
open
arms
and
i
so
what
it
is
a
when
spoken
some
sound
words
of
sympathy
and
encouragement
we
sat
consider
question
what
was
chair
occupied
still
where
it
stood—for
a
way
with
of
about
one
spot
in
one
unsettled
manner
and
going
one
of
observances
with
and
and
and
of
cards
and
what
as
if
it
were
all
on
a
slate—i
say
chair
where
it
stood
unconsciously
it
moment
started
out
of
it
it
away
and
another
occasion
say
after
conceived
an
aversion
my
i
occasion
confess
my
own
we
interchanged
confidence
without
shaping
a
syllable
what
said
i
when
was
safe
in
another
chair—what
is
my
i
am
stunned
so
was
i
when
still
something
must
is
intent
upon
expenses—horses
and
carriages
and
appearances
of
all
kinds
must
stopped
somehow
you
mean
you
can’t
accept—
can
i
i
interposed
as
of
at
an
involuntary
shudder
over
of
us
yet
i
am
afraid
is
is
attached
me
strongly
attached
me
was
ever
such
a
my
said
i
after
all
stopping
short
another
what
i
owe
already
again
i
am
in
me
who
expectations—and
i
calling
and
i
am
well
well
well

only
one
i
am
and
is
go
a
soldier

an
ignorant

one
idea
more

of
a
and
character
i

i
what

she
was
only
coming
at
all
a
while
i
could
make
of

conclusion
should
said
about

agreed
many
in

of
i
meanness
i
was
under

was
capable
of
almost
any

as
i
afterwards

often
while
it
was
at

one
eye
at
a
which
was
on
convenience
of
sweeping
in

at
of

airy
and
in
which
mr
was
audible
i
comfortably
settled
expressed
alarm
and
seemed
was
worth
mentioning
it
struck
me
was
softened—indefinably
i
could
said
and
could
afterwards
when
i
certainly
opportunity
given
me
in
my
say
compeyson
anything
i
knew
animosity
man
might
otherwise
seeking
out
and
on
own
when
and
i
sat
with
i
asked
of
all
whether
on
wemmick’s
and
sources
of
information
ay
ay
answered
with
a
grave
knows
i
with
wemmick
said
i
and
come
you
what
caution
gave
me
and
what
advice
i
accurately
with
mentioned
and
i
wemmick
in
whether
officers
or
i
could
say
was
under
some
suspicion
and
my
chambers
watched
wemmick
keeping
close
a
and
my
keeping
away
and
what
wemmick
said
about
getting
abroad
i
added
of
course
when
came
i
should
go
with
or
should
close
upon
as
might
safest
in
wemmick’s
what
was
i
upon
indeed
was
i
at
all
clear
or
comfortable
about
it
in
my
own
mind
i
saw
in
softer
condition
and
in
my
sake
as
altering
my
way
of
enlarging
my
expenses
i
it
whether
in
our
unsettled
and
circumstances
it
would
simply
if
it
were
worse
could
and
indeed
was
coming
was
a
said
and
always
known
it
a
would
make
it
a
and
of
safety
with
such
good
who
at
and
said
something
come
into
arising
out
of
wemmick’s
suggestion
which
it
might
worth
while
we
are
good
watermen
and
could
ourselves
when
comes
would
and
would
save
at
a
chance
of
suspicion
and
any
chance
is
worth
saving
mind
season
you
it
might
a
good
if
you
at
once
keep
a
at
stairs
and
were
in
of
up
and
you
into
and
who
or
minds
it
or
and
is
special
in
your
it
or
i
scheme
and
was
quite
elated
it
we
agreed
it
should
carried
into
execution
and
should
us
if
we
came
and
mill
we
agreed
should
in
of
window
which
gave
upon
east
whenever
saw
us
and
all
was
our
conference
ended
and
everything
arranged
i
go
and
i
go

encumbered
with
a
growth
of
i
my
a
childish
association
with
wonderful
in
moment
of
slight
action
and
i
i
saw

great
of

into
where

upon
close
with

in
moment
when
i
was
withdrawing

go
quietly
away
i
saw
a
great
spring
up
in

moment
i
saw
at
me
shrieking
with
a
whirl
of
all
about
and
soaring
at
as
many
above
as
she
was
i
a
greatcoat
on
and
over
my
arm
another
coat
i
got
off
closed
with

got
over
i
great
cloth

and
with
it
of
in

and
all
ugly
sheltered
we
were
on
ground
struggling

and
closer
i
covered
more
wildly
she
shrieked
and
occurred

coming
in
with
cries
at

still
with
all
my
strength
a
who
might
escape
and
i
if

even
knew
who
she
was

why
we
struggled
or
she
in

were
out
until
i
saw
of
garments
alight
in
a
shower
around
us
she
was
insensible
and
i
was
afraid
moved
or
even
assistance
was
sent
and
i
until
it
came
as
if
i
unreasonably
i
i
if
i
go
would
out
again
and
consume
when
i
got
up
on

a
old
in

with
an
undisturbed
expression
of

sat
as
composed
and
contented
as
if
we
were
already
out
of
england
yet
was
as
submissive
a
word
of
advice
as
if
in
constant
when
we
ashore
get
some
of
into
and
was
stepping
out
i
i
would
safest
where
was
and
said
you
and
quietly
sat
again
air
cold
upon
it
was
a
and
sunshine
was
cheering
strong
i
care
of
it
and
our
steady
stroke
carried
us
on
well
imperceptible
as
out
we
more
and
more
of
woods
and
and
and
muddy
was
yet
with
us
when
we
were
off
gravesend
as
our
charge
was
wrapped
in
cloak
i
within
a
or
of
custom
and
so
out
catch

alongside
of
emigrant
ships
and
under
of
a

on
at
us
and
soon
slacken
and
craft
at
anchor
swing
and
all
swung
and
ships
were
advantage
of
get
up
crowd
upon
us
in
a
and
we
kept
under
shore
as
much
out
of
strength
of
as
we
could
standing
carefully
off
shallows
and
mudbanks
our
oarsmen
were
so
of
occasionally
with
a
minute
or
a
quarter
of
an
as
much
as
wanted
we
got
ashore
among
some
slippery
stones
while
we
ate
and
what
we
with
us
and
about
it
was
my
own
marsh
country
and
monotonous
and
with
a
while
winding
and
and
great
upon
it
and
and
everything
else
seemed
stranded
and
still
of
of
ships
was
we
and
green
strawladen
with
a
sail
and
some
shaped
a
child’s
imitation
of
a
in
mud
and
a
squat
shoallighthouse
on
open
stood
crippled
in
mud
on
stilts
and
crutches
and
slimy
stakes
stuck
out
of
mud
and
slimy
stones
stuck
out
of
mud
and
and
stuck
out
of
mud
and
an
old
and
an
old
slipped
into
mud
and
all
about
us
was
stagnation
and
mud
we
off
again
and
made
what
way
we
could
it
was
much
work
and
startop
and
and
and
until
sun
went
us
a
so
we
could
see
above
was
sun
on
of
shore
in
a
into
and
was
solitary
marsh
and
away
were
grounds
which
and
us
seemed
save
and
in
a
melancholy
gull
as
was

said
in
a
of
interest
a
wanderer—you

a
sufficient
and
i
well
i

estella
earnestly
