a
weight
on
as
she
saw

in

was
a
strange
about
it
as
if
mortal

slowly
away
and
immortal
shining
with
an
indescribably
saw
and

is
overcome

seemed
something
sacred
in
silence

and
quiet
weeks
when

what

an

shut
yourself

would
covers
a
multitude
of

are
and
go
sleep
if
you
i
intend
work
said
amy
in
most
energetic
what
enthusiasm
and
against
a
urn
with
an
air
of
entire
satisfaction
what
would
say
if
she
saw
you
asked
amy
impatiently
stir
up
mention
of
still
more
energetic
sister’s
as
usual
away
i’m
as
spoke
was
and
a
shade
over
utterance
of
wound
was
yet
and
shadow
struck
amy
she
seen
and
and
she
up
in
catch
a
expression
on
of
and
it
was
gone
she
could
study
it
and
expression
again
she
watched
a
moment
with
artistic
an
italian
as
in
sun
with
uncovered
and
eyes
of
southern
seemed
and
into
a
you
effigy
of
a
young
knight
asleep
on
she
said
carefully
wellcut
against
stone
wish
i
was
a
wish
unless
you
spoiled
your
you
are
so
changed
i
sometimes
amy
stopped
with
a
more
significant
unfinished
speech
saw
and
understood
affectionate
anxiety
which
she
express
and
straight
into
eyes
said
as
used
say
it
mother
it’s
all
ma’am
satisfied
and
set
at
worry
it
also
and
she
showed
it
cordial
in
which
she
said
i’m
glad
of
i
you’d
a
i
you
might
wasted
money
at
wicked
your
some
charming
with
a
or
got
into
some
of
scrapes
young
men
seem
consider
a
of
a
stay
out
in
sun
come
and
on
grass
and
us
as
used
say
when
we
got
in
sofa
corner
and
secrets
obediently
on
and
amuse
sticking
into
of
amy’s
i’m
all
secrets
and
glanced
up
with
a
expression
of
interest
in
eyes
i’ve
you
may
one
myself
with
i
you’d
some
you
all
come
you
often
i
would
send
you
she’s
i’m
about
so
it’s
impossible
you
know
when
you
your
great
work
of
art
asked
changing
subject
abruptly
after
another
in
which
wondering
if
amy
knew
secret
and
wanted
about
it
she
answered
with
a
air
all
out
of
me
after
seeing
wonders
i
insignificant
and
gave
up
all
my
in
why
should
you
with
so
much
energy
and
why
isn’t
genius
and
amount
of
energy
can
make
it
so
i
want
great
or
i
won’t
a
commonplace
so
i
intend
any
more
and
what
are
you
going
with
yourself
if
i
may
ask
up
my
other
and
an
ornament
society
if
i
get
chance
it
was
a
characteristic
speech
and
sounded
audacity
young
and
amy’s
ambition
a
good
smiled
spirit
with
which
she
up
a
when
a
one
and
spent
good
and
is
where
comes
in
i
amy
a
silence
was
a
conscious
in
made
sit
up
and
say
gravely
i’m
going
and
ask
questions
may
i
i
answer
your
will
if
your
won’t
you
aren’t
woman
of
world
enough
yet
your
my
i
about
and
you
year
and
it’s
my
opinion
if
called
so
suddenly
and
so
something
would
come
of
it
me
say
was
amy’s
grim
would
smile
and
was
a
sparkle
of
eye
which
she
knew
and
enjoyed
knowledge
you
are
engaged
i
and
elderbrotherly
and
grave
all
of
a
sudden
you
will
if
comes
and
goes
on
knees
won’t
you
you
are
of
old
i
could
if
i
you
intend
moment
my
soul
what
unearthly
a
good
amy
man
i
you’d
is
a
gentleman
and
manners
amy
quite
cool
and
a
ashamed
of
in
spite
of
sincerity
of
intentions
i
understand
queens
of
society
can’t
get
on
without
money
so
you
mean
make
a
good
match
and
start
in
way
quite
and
as
world
goes
it
sounds
odd
of
one
of
your
mother’s
girls
a
short
speech
quiet
with
which
it
was
uttered
contrasted
curiously
with
young
speaker
instinctively
and
again
with
a
sense
of
which
could
explain
and
silence
as
well
as
a
certain
inward
selfdisapproval
amy
and
made
without
i
wish
you’d
me
yourself
a
she
said
sharply
it
me
a
girl
i
could
if
i
and
she
as
if
she
would
it
in
most
summary
style
i
give
you
who
enjoyed
someone
after
abstinence
you’d
angry
in
minutes
i’m
angry
with
you
it
make
a
you
are
as
cool
and
soft
as
snow
you
know
what
i
can
snow
a
glow
and
a
if
applied
your
indifference
is
affectation
and
a
good
stirring
up
would
it
stir
away
it
won’t
me
and
it
may
amuse
you
as
man
said
when
wife
me
in
of
a
or
a
carpet
and
you
are
if
sort
of
exercise
agrees
with
you
and
see
shake
off
apathy
so
altered
amy
sharpened
and
and
and
i
got
a
you
it’s
you
it
she
it
would
annoy
only
arms
under
with
an
imperturbable
you
you
want
know
what
i
of
you
well
i
you
if
she
even
said
you’
in
a
or
coquettish
would
and
it
grave
almost
sad
accent
in
made
open
eyes
and
ask
quickly
why
if
you
with
every
chance
good
useful
and
you
are
and
miserable
strong
mademoiselle
if
you
it
i’ll
go
on
it’s
quite
interesting
i
you’d
it
so
selfish
always
about
am
i
selfish
question
slipped
out
involuntarily
and
in
a
of
surprise
one
on
which
was
generosity
yes
selfish
continued
amy
in
a
calm
cool
as
effective
as
an
angry
one
i’ll
show
you
i’ve
studied
you
while
we
were
and
i’m
at
all
satisfied
with
you

abroad
six
months
and
waste

and
your

a
any
after
a
grind
you
as
if

as
as
i
can
see

so
as
when

you
at

abominably

and

are
contented
and
admired
silly
instead
of
and
wise
ones
with
money
and
ah
you
old
it’s
so
i
can’t
saying
it
with
all
splendid
use
and
enjoy
you
can
and
instead
of
man

ought
you
are
only
she
stopped
with
a
and
in
it
saint
on
a
gridiron
added
sentence
effect
was
a
wideawake
sparkle
in
eyes
and
a
expression
indifference

supposed
you’d
it
so
you
men

we
are
angels
and
say
we
can
make
you
what
we
will
instant
we
you
good

at
us
and
won’t
which
much
your
is
worth
amy
spoke
and
on
exasperating
martyr
at
in
a
minute
a
came
over
so
she
could
and
said
with
a
imitation
of
a
child
i
will
good
oh

amy
she
was
in
earnest
and
on
outspread
with
said
soberly

you
ashamed
of
a
it’s
as
soft
and
white
as

as
suddenly
as

of

even
amy
she
glanced
at
with
a
in
mind
was
with
over
as
if
shade
and
mustache
mouth
she
only
saw
chest
and
with
a
might
a
sigh
and
wore
into
grass
as
if
something
or
spoken
of
all
in
a
minute
and
assumed
shape
and
significance
in
amy’s
mind
and
what
sister
confided
she
spoke
of
she
shadow
on
change
in
character
and
wearing
of
old
which
was
ornament
a
girls
are
quick
such
signs
and
eloquence
amy
a
was
at
of
alteration
and
she
was
sure
of
it
keen
eyes
and
when
she
spoke
again
it
was
in
a
could
soft
and
kind
when
she
chose
make
it
so
i
know
i
so
you
and
if
you
weren’t
sweetesttempered
in

you’d
angry
with
me

quite
as

knocked
off
with
a
of
sentiments

and
she

impetuous
and
away

manfully

of
one
who

asking
sympathy
and
away

and

shrug
your
shoulders
and
she

more

with
eyes
and
one
a
cigar
which

of
smoke
encircled

a
genuine
surprise
and
at
skill
adding
with
a
yes

as
you
were
and
amy
another
sketch
one
it
was
so
well
was
a
and
spirit
in
it
which
atoned
many
and
it
so
a
sudden
change
swept
over
young
man’s
as
only
a
sketch
of
a
and
coat
were
off
and
every
of
active
and
commanding
attitude
was
of
energy
and
meaning
subdued
stood
arching
under
with
one
impatiently
ground
and
ears
up
as
if
mastered
in
mane
and
erect
attitude
was
a
suggestion
of
suddenly
arrested
motion
of
strength
courage
and
youthful
contrasted
sharply
with
supine
grace
of
sketch
said
as
eye
went
one
other
amy
saw
up
and
as
if
and
accepted

and
without

and
chatted
all

and
up
monsieur

madamoiselle

in
charming

way
i’d
a
english
all
sentimental
salutations
in
goodbye
and
with
words
uttered
in
she
after
a
almost
in
its
morning
instead
of

adding
with
an
involuntary
sigh
yes

comes
in
of

secretly
against

which
we
call

gave
entire
confidence

and
consolation
in

come
when
could
only
as
and
as
man
and
woman
able
and
glad
serve
each
other
with
mutual
sympathy
as
well
as
mutual
in
old
study
which
called

and
which
she
came
with
courage
cheerfulness
and
a
more
submissive
spirit
who
one

without

use
its
opportunities
with
gratitude
and
other
wholesome
and
would
in

and
which
she
slowly
see
and
and
could
as
as
once
over
and
something
of
spirit
seemed
around
mop
and
old
away
as
she
used
songs
used
imitating
orderly
ways
and
giving
and
kept
everything
and
cozy
which
was
step
making
she
know
it
said
with
an
approving
squeeze
of

i
wonder
if

she
was
glad
see
a
glimmer
of

enforce
opinion
every
argument
in
and
sisterly
chats
were
wasted
especially
as
of
meg’s
most
effective
arguments
were
whom
grief
is
opener
of
some
and
was
a
more
sunshine
a
impatient
shake
a

gently
and
kernal
sound
and
sweet
if
she
suspected
she
would
shut
up
and
more
ever
she
wasn’t
about
so
when

and
worldly
amy
work
miracles

and
sheets
with
a
careful
as
one
might
shut
covers
of
a
which
end
comes
and
alone
in
workaday
world
again
away
upstairs
it
was
and
she
could
walk
a
spirit
and
old
came
again
as
it
once
was
a
sorrowfully
wonder
why
one
sister
should
all
she
asked
other
it
was
she
knew
and
it
away
craving
affection
was
strong
and
amy’s
woke
someone
with
and
soul
and
cling
while
god
up
in
garret
where
unquiet
wanderings
ended
stood
wooden
chests
in
a
each
marked
with
its
owners
and
each
with
of
childhood
and
girlhood
ended
all
glanced
into
and
when
she
came
own
chin
on
edge
and
stared
absently
at
chaotic
collection
a
of
old
exercise
caught
eye
she
out
over
and
winter
at
kind
mrs
kirke’s
she
smiled
at
she
sad
and
when
she
came
a
message
written
in
slid
out
of
and
she
sat
at
words
as
a
meaning
and
a
spot
in
wait
me
my
i
may
a
i
shall
surely
come
oh
if
only
would
so
kind
so
good
so
with
me
always
my
old
i
enough
when
i
i
should
see
everyone
seems
going
away
me
and
i’m
all
alone
and
as
if
it
were
a
yet
on
a
comfortable
and
cried
as
if
in
opposition
on
was
it
all
selfpity
or
spirits
or
was
it
waking
up
of
a
sentiment
which
its
as
as
its
inspirer
who
shall
say
chapter
surprises
was
alone
in
on
old
sofa
at
and
it
was
way
of
spending
of
one
and
she
used
on
stories
or
of
sister
who
seemed
away
grave
and
sad
was
and
she
was
years
went
old
she
was
getting
and
she
seemed
accomplished
almost
and
show
it
was
mistaken
in
was
a
good
show
and
she
saw
and
was
grateful
it
an
old
maid
what
i’m
a
spinster
with
a
a
spouse
a
of
stories
children
and
years
a
morsel
of
when
i’m
old
and
can’t
enjoy
it
solitary
and
can’t
share
it
independent
and
it
well
i
a
sour
saint
a
selfish
sinner
and
i
say
old
maids
are
comfortable
when
get
used
it
and
sighed
as
if
was
inviting
it
seldom
is
at
and
seems
end
of
all
it’s
as
as
it
and
one
can
get
on
quite
if
one
something
in
one’s
self
upon
at
girls
about
old
maids
secretly
will
at
say
about
it
quietly
accept
and
if
sensible
console
more
useful
years
in
which
may
grow
old
gracefully
at
spinsters
girls
often
are
away
in
so
quietly
under
sober
gowns
and
many
silent
sacrifices
of
youth
ambition
itself
make
in
god’s
sight
even
sad
sour
sisters
should
kindly
with
missed
sweetest
of
if
other
and
at
with
compassion
contempt
girls
in

miss

come
in

kindness
and
will
as
sweet
as
and
admiration
gentlemen
which
means
courteous

and
only
chivalry

is
which

my
suddenly
ghost
seemed

a
substantial
ghost
over

staring

up

impossible
especially
of

shocking
it
was
a

excessively
ill

more

indifference

i
it
succeeds
in
my
opinion
it
is
a
a
mean
art
undoubtedly
whom
was
chiefly
addressed
is
meanness
in
all
arts
which
sometimes
condescend
employ
captivation

compliments

serious
went
away
as

it
was
should
ever
see
each
other
again
on
such
of
cordiality
as
marked
several
meetings
in
and
as
she
a
glance
over
whole
of
acquaintance
so
of
contradictions
and
sighed
at
of
which
would
its
continuance
and
would
in
its

gratitude
and
esteem

good

affection
elizabeth’s
change
of
sentiment
will
improbable
if
otherwise
if
springing
such
sources
is
unreasonable
or
unnatural
in
comparison
of
what
is
so
often
as
arising
on
a
interview
with
its
object

even
words
exchanged

somewhat
of
a
method
in
wickham

its
ill
success
might
authorize
seek
other
interesting
mode
of
attachment
as
it
may
she
saw
go
with
and
in
early

of
what
infamy

additional
anguish
as
she
on
wretched

all
astonishment
wickham
should
marry
a
girl
whom
it
was
impossible
could
marry

and
could
ever

appeared
incomprehensible
it
was
all
such
an
attachment
as
she
might

she
suppose
engaging
in

without

it
over
again
elizabeth
said
uncle
as
and
upon
serious
consideration
i
am
much
more
inclined
i
was
as
your
eldest
sister
of
matter
it
appears
me
so
unlikely
any
young
man
should
such
a
against
a
girl
who
is
means
unprotected
or
and
who
was
actually
staying
in
colonel’s
i
am
strongly
inclined
could
expect
would
step
could
expect
again
after
such
an
affront
colonel
is
adequate
you
so
cried
elizabeth
up
a
moment
upon
my
word
said
mrs
gardiner
i
of
your
uncle’s
opinion
it
is
great
a
of
and
interest
guilty
of
it
i
cannot
so
ill
of
wickham
can
you
yourself
so
wholly
give
up
as
capable
of
it
of
own
interest
of
every
other
i
can
capable
if
indeed
it
should
so
i
it
why
should
go
on
scotland
if
case
in
mr
gardiner
is
absolute
are
gone
scotland
oh
chaise
into
a

such
a

exceptionable
it
is
money

it
might
strike
could
more
economically
expeditiously
married
in
in

why
all

why
any
of
why
must

oh
is
most
you
see
account
was
of
intending
marry
wickham
will
marry
a
woman
without
some
money
cannot
afford
it
and
what
claims
what
attractions
she
youth
and
good
could
make
sake
every
chance
of
marrying
well
as
what
apprehensions
of
in

might
on
a

with
i
am
able
i
know
of
effects
such
a
step
might
as
your
other
objection
i
am
afraid
it
will
good
step
and
might
imagine
my
indolence
and
attention
ever
seemed

what
was
going
in

as
about

a
matter
can
you
is
so
everything
of
as
consent
with
on
any
other

it
seem
and
it
is
most
shocking
indeed
elizabeth
with
in

in
such
a
should
admit
of

know
what

i
am

and
year
a

adopt
any
opinions

give
greaterwhat

i
call
itsusceptibility
which
are
enough
and
we
all
know
wickham
every
charm
of
and
address
can
captivate
a
woman
you
see
said
aunt
so
ill
of
wickham
as
capable
of

ill
and
who

well
as
i
what
wickham

indeed
elizabeth

at
in
what
manner
spoke
of
man
who
with
such
and
and
are
other
circumstances
which
i
am
at
it
is
worth
while
about

endless
what
said
of
miss

a
girl

moderate
of
