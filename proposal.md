## Proposal Ideas
1. Distributed computing: <br>
    - distribute computation on a large dataset over multiple nodes and show how much faster it is
    - p2p machine learning
2. Storage: <br>
    - building a distributed file system (each node can upload and pull files)
3. Failure detection <br>
    - Use Paxos (other consensus algorithms) on a failure detection system to really check in a distributed system if a node has failed
